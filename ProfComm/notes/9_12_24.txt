interview prep


1. tell us a bit about yourself
my name is casey, I am an undergraduate computer science student at Johns Hopkins. I really love problem solving, and more specifically finding the best ways
to solve a problem


2. tell us about a time when you overcame a setback or failed
In high school I was very bad with remembering deadlines and scheduled events. once I had an exam for a course I was taking at a community college
and I just forgot about the exam. I realized a few hours too late, and probably would have failed the course, but the professor was extremely graceful
and made accomodations with me to avoid that. Since then, I have been hyperattentive to deadlines; everything I schedule goes into my calendar where I can't miss it,
and I never get complacent with thinking I don't have anything going on until I triple check my calendar.

3. what questions do you have for us
what does a typical day look like for your engineers? do they have a standard day?

Tailscale is a fully remote company. what does Tailscale do to improve collaboration between employees?

Open source software is an important aspect of the company. what kinds of other open source projects do employees contribute to?
