slide designs

structure presentations like stories, not info dumps

- story architecture
- perspective
- contrast/conflict/unexpected
- STAR moments (situation task action result)

have:
- beginning
- middle
- end

beginning
- needs a "hook"
  - shock factor (statistic)
  - relatable (ask a question, fact relating to audience)

e.g. "Scams against people over 60 years old were responsible for over 3 billion dollars in losses in 2023 alone."
e.g. "In 2023, the FBI reported that scammers stole more than 3 billion dollars from people over 60 years old."
e.g. "How many of your grandparents use a computer at home?"
e.g. "People over 60 are the number one target for scammers"
e.g. "Picture this: a person in a ski mask steals your grandmother's purse and runs off into the night, never to be seen again. 
  This is what's happening to 30,000 of our grandparents every year online."


WIFFY:
  What
  Is in it
  For (chorus: for!)
  Your audience

design principles:
  SNR: signal to noise ratio
  picture superiority effect: we remember images more than text
  empty space: helps amplify and emphasize
  contrast: creates dynamism; lean in when necessary
  repetition: unites your slides
  alignment: visual connection; rule of thirds
  proximity: related items grouped together

SNR
  simplify info on slide
  emphasize what is important to focus on (bold, red font, etc)

picture superiority effect
  image as background to "set the stage" of the slide
  images as the main visual feature

empty space
  draws eyes to visual elements that are important
  too much clutter is BAD
  too much text = too much reading ==> ignore speaker
  use minimalism

contrast
  use colors that contrast well
  use visually pleasing colors
  red with blac/white/gray

repetition
  use the same style across slides
  consistency

alignment
  
minimalism
  rule of thirds
    slide is a 3x3 grid
    visual elements should lie on the "lines" of the grid

proximity
