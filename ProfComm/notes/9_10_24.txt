anecdotes activity

when I was the president of rugby I had a player get into an accident with our rented vans on the way to a match. I had to deal with relaying this information
to our club advisor, and make sure that the players were able to make it to the match. I collected the necessary information about the accident and immediately
told our advisor, without calling out the individual player and placing the blame on them. I then arranged for one of the players to use their personal car, offering
to reimburse for the gas expense from our club budget. We were able to make it to the match on time.

At work, I had to figure out a way to get the version info about a piece of software we use. I created scripts to automate this, consulting docs to figure
out exactly what was needed in the scripts. I also consulted with my supervisor to gather the exact details of what was needed. The scripts I created were used
to automate a part of my supervisors tasks, making us both more efficient with our jobs.


- talk about my background more, where I use these interests/skills/abilities
- I am a problem solver
- I can assess a problem and figure out what is needed, and ask follow up questions to figure this information out
- I like to take simple tasks and automate them to make myself and others more efficient
