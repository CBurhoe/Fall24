ask yourself:
  how much time do I have
    5 min
  who is the audience
    other students at JHU who I want to involve in the project
  what is their background
    students in undergrad, may have interests in community service (for their resumes), could have valuable contributions for solving community outreach problems
  what do i want them to do
    join my project or help advocate for or support my work
  what is the core purpose of the talk
    to show the impact of elder financial exploitation and show that increasing awareness in the elderly population is one of the best methods for combating it
    propose a collaborative educational board game as a solution
  what's the big picture here
    
  what is my core point
    elderly adults need to be educated on how to avoid falling victim to internet scams
  why does it matter
    elder financial exploitation accounts for hundreds of millions to billions of dollars in damages each year and is quickly growing


craft the story:
  who are your characters
    elderly adults, scammers, bystanders, educational outreach staff (us)
  what's the conflict
    scammers want to take advantage of elderly adults and steal their money; we want to prevent that from happening
  what's the beginning, middle, and end
    1. computers came about and the lack of experience of elderly adults led to them becoming more and more targeted by scams
    2. we are recognizing the massive impact of scams on the elderly population, including their susceptibility and the losses, both financial
      and emotional, that result
    3. we propose educational programs to help spread awareness and empower elderly adults to be able to recognize scams and avoid becoming victims
