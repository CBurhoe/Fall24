lots of research involved in grant writing

state concrete outcomes of the program/curriculum
  "by the end of the course, students will be able to..."

make writing as accessible as possible

process:
  know what reader wants
    - write what reader needs to hear
    - don't write what you want to say
  know your funding source
    - to gear writing towards them
  research the priorities of the RFP and the funding agency
  
  persuasive writing
    - convince the reader why *I* should get the funding agency's money before anyone else

  state
    - how much money I'm asking for
    - how many students I'm going to train with this money
    - how long will it take
    - how many students per time per money

state outcomes
  - develop way to evaluate outcomes
  - backtrack to how we'll accomplish outcomes
