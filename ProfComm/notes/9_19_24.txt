establish novelty with four rhetorical moves
1. explain significance of issue
2. describe the status quo
3. identify a gap
4. fill that gap with your present research

summarizing and synthesizing our sources lets us frame our research problem (and sometimes helps us find it)


literature reviews:
1. explain relevant background info
2. group research into trends
3. take a stance on prior work


notice how trends appear in topic sentences
"prior research comparing search patterns on different devices has found that searches are more constrained on mobile devices than on PCs"
...
"these studies indicate that there are unique patterns to user activity on different devices that can be mined to predict cross-device search"


use phrases that clearly indicate a research trend or theme
"one trend in the research focuses on..."
"several studies emphasize..."

disagreement can also be a research trend or theme
"research has failed to come to a consensus"
"findings are inconclusive"
"there are competing explanations/theories"
