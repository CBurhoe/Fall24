today: scenarios

scenario-based design
- persona
- scenario
- storyboard


why use scenarios
- descriptions of people using technology that is essential in discussing and analyzing how the technology is used to reshape their activities
- scenarios can be created before a system is built
- scenarios can be used to prototype the whole experience

common uses of SBD
- interface design
- marketing
- software engineering
- advertising
- etc.

tasks, personas, scenarios
- task: design-agnostic objective
- persona: a fictional person with a backstory
- scenario: narrative that demonstrates a persona completing a task using a particular design

writing scenarios
- identify people involved in scenario
- identify starting state/context
- list the goals a user may have as they pertain to your product or service
- prioritize the goals based on your understanding of your users
- craft stories

what is a persona
- a representative character meant to reoresent a group of users in a role who share common goals, attitudes, and behaviors
  when interacting with a particular product or service
- describes user demographics, education, income, tech experience, job, goals, needs, desires, etc.
- answers the question "who are our users?"

persona goals; each persona should capture user goals at different levels
- life goals: personal aspirations ("I would like to retire before 50")
- experience goals: how the user wants to feel while using a product
- end goals: tangible outcomes of using the product ("I would like to see my emails and facebook messages in one display")

how to create personas
1. collect data about users
2. segment the users
3. develop archetypal characters who represent a universal pattern e.g. "hero, creator, sage"


step 1: collect data
- personas should come from real data from users
  - should help us identify range of behavioral patterns, environmental factors/constraints
- data could be of any type
  - qualitative data from ethnography, observations, interviews with real users
  - quantitative data from large scale surveys, studies, marketing & customer support reports
  - logical characterizations ...

step 2: segment users
- analyze data to identify emerging categories of users
  - focus particularly on grouping users based on goals or motivations for technology
- qualitative data analysis e.g. affinity diagramming

step 3: develop archetypal characters
- represent each segment with a character
- describe the archetype
- find archetypal image
- give persona a name
- describe user goals related to the product
- create a bio and describe personal information that affects usage
- describe technology use, emphasizing skills and needs

warnings
- personas are not stereotypes
  - stereotypes might be formed by prejudice, cultural and historical factors
  - personas must represent data from the real world as it is right now
- personas are not the same as roles
  - people with the ...


what are scenarios
- a story that describes ...

scenario characteristics
- described from users POV and captures aspects of their goals and needs
- concrete descriptions of a user interacting with a system in a work-driven manner, focusing on a particular path that user takes
- does not include implementation details but may include details of the workplace environment, socio-cultural situation, constraints

personas in scenarios
- personas are the actors in each scenario and provide the motivation constraints knowledge and other details about users performing actions in the scenario
- scenarios describe a persona's goal-driven behavior

what do we do with scenarios
- use to communicate ideas to other designers
- describe design specifications to clients
- evaluate ideas with users

scenario presentation
- narrative scenarios (book)
  - written accounts and narratives
- video scenarios (movies)
  - richer visual storytelling
- storyboards (comics, picture books)

video scenarios
advantages
  - can be more engaging
  - prototypes are shown more easily
disadvantages
  - requires actors
  - more resources to create

storyboards
- used in movies, multimedia design, product and software development
elements of a storyboard
- level of details
- inclusion of text
- inclusion of people and emotions
- number of frames
- protrayal of time


guideline 1: detail
- too much detail can lose universality

guideline 2: text use
- often necessary, but keep it short

guideline 3: people and emotions
- include people experiencing the design and their reactions to it (good or bad)
- point of storyboards is to convey the experience of using a system

guideline 4: number of frames
- 4-6 frames is ideal
- more is not always better, may lose focus of story, may lose reader's attention

guideline 5: time
- only use if it is necessary to understand story
- order of frames implies movement of time

drawing not necessary! can use pictures, generative AI images, etc

lecture activity: create personas and scenarios for a news aggregator website

persona: brian is a university student. he is intersted in news about artificial intelligence regulations and development around the world.
scenario: brian needs to get news about a recent development in AI technology from the US or EU within the last week to present in his ethics class.
