what did you learn about brainstorm?

don't forget exit ticket


project proposal
  - submit by 9/11
  - green light or receive feedback
  - revise and greenlight by 9/18
  

contextual inquiry (CI)
  - field data to practical innovation
  - leave your office to find design ideas
  - method for gathering and representing data about the user and their work

the user is not liking me
  according to Don Norman:
  - designers are much more familiar with the interface and with the problems being solved than users
  - designers work in settings that are different than the context in which the product may be used
  - designers may have different skills than users (e.g. perceptual, cognitive, and domain skills)

we design from data & context
  - understand the users work
  - requires design team to agree on common observations and their representation
  - observations reveal hidden aspects of work that may be implicit in the user's understanding
  - challenge: "the users cannot describe what they really do because they are not conscious of it and do not reflect on it"

purpose of ci
  - obtain data from a user in their context
  - insights about the users environment, their many tasks, the people they work with, cultural influences in their work (starbucks vs dunkin as study space)
  - understanding of breakdowns in current processes
  - to help define requirements, plans/designs, and priority

go where the customer works, observe the customer as he or she works, talk to the customer about their work- gain a better understanding of your customer

involves: participatory design, social sci, cog sci, ethnography

people usually cannot say what innovations they would like, and even when they can, are sometimes wrong about what could be helpful
  e.g. x-ray example, beyer & holtzblatt
  
are you solving the right problem?

ci approach
  - have conversations with users in the context of their work
  - direct obeservation is best
  - when not possible, cued recall of past experiences or re-creation of related experiences

failure points
  - context
    - must be performed in the setting of the participant
    - ongoing experience
      - retrospective accounts are often summaries
      - by being present in the time and place of an activity we can access much richer data from ongoing activities
    - abstract/concrete data
      - humans also have a tendency to abstract, save time, and convey points they feel are important
      - reduces amount and quality of data in ci
      - focus on real tasks and artifacts

  - partnership
    - master/apprentice model, investigator is humble
      - you are the apprentice, user is the master
      - teaching while doing means that the user doesn't have to think in advance what to convey
      - allows discovery of subtle details which may be overlooked in canned discussion
      - reduces need for a formal set of interview questions
    interview data & what to look for
      - concrete answers no generalities
      - think aloud
      - avoid summaries
      - be aware of 
        - workarounds
        - mismatch between what people say and do offhand under the breath comments
        - sights
        - rolling of eyes
        - confessions

  - interpretation
    - it is good to regularly check your interpretations
    - i saw you just do X, is that because of Y?
    - if you had a technology that did X, would it solve this problem
    - as long as you check your interpretations in context, participants will respond accurately
    - vet you design ideas
    - 
  
  - focus (modeling)
    - group interpretation
      - max of 48 hours after interview, group interpretation is conducted
      - outputs of this meeting are: notes, questions, design ideas and breakdowns, indexed by user number (important to keep anon)
      - a set of work models
      
what to avoid
  - not being inquisitive/nosy enough
  - if you have the impulse to ask, do it right away
  - overly disrupting a task
  - turn into a regular interview
  - if you could have done it in a coffee shop or your office, it wasn't a CI

CI summary
  - why? design products to meet users needs
  - how? observe real work/play in aciton
  - four principles: context partnership, interpretation, focus
  - focus-setting meeting: team, brainstorm, affinity, generalize, review
