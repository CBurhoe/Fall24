"the best way to have a good idea is to have a lot of ideas" - Linus Pauling (Nobel Prize in Chemistry)


externalize your ideas
- best way to figureo out what is wrong with bad ideas
  - sketches
  - prototypes
  - demonstrations
  - others?
- the more externalized, the more visible flaws become apparent to you and others

surrounding context
- e.g. how would you improve your travel times to work in baltimore?
- consider
  - traffic patterns
  - public transit
  - rush hour traffic
  - road surfaces
  - others?


affinity diagramming
- idea clustering
- organize ideas into a hierarchy
- built bottom-up
- usually done in a chaotic fashion with design team members running back and forth with post-its and yelling ideas to each other



ideas flow, speed ideation, brain dumping
