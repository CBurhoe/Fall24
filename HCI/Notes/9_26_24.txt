parts of a test plan


introducing a test
- interested in learning about X
- I did not develop X, I just want to learn about problems with it
- I'll give you tasks, just do your best
- it is X being tested, not you
- think out loud while working with X
- I will not be able to answer questions once you start using X, do you have questions now?

task based scenario
- set up overall scenario
- prescribe tasks for users fitting the scenario
- ask users to perform these during test
  - improvision okay- just watch the time

creating tasks
- write a short, set the stage
- write a numbered list of tasks
- tasks should be realistic, doable, ethical, clear, succinct, and focused on uncertain aspects of the design
- chain tasks so one leads into the next naturally

running the test
- give opening scenario
- begin assigning tasks in order
- observe task time, errors, breakdowns, workarounds, confusions, and success/failure
- make notes, video-record, audio-records
- give think aloud prompts
  - but allow them to stray
  - and don't answer questions- let them struggle

types of data
- objective measurements
  - things can be measured objectively the same by everyone
  - time, errors, confusions, breakdowns, workarounds, successes, failures
- behavioral measurements
  - mostly your observations and notes
- subjective measurements
  - users comments and feedback, questionnaire

debriefing and data analysis
- debrief
  - give more detail about what you're interested in discovering
    - answer questions they have
    - thank them for time
- analysis
  - gather notes, etc
  - distill main findings in a document


non-task-based testing

task vs open exploration
- task based usability tests are easiest to control, focus, direct
- open exploration tests can also be used to understand people's initial experiences

co-discovery
- two users work together and talk to each other out loud to accomplish assigned tasks
- observers can learn a lot from hearing two people talk to each other
- downsides?
  - cost: no-shows are more problematic; group effects come in- one disruptive user ruins two

how many users to test with
- N(1-(1-L)^N)
  - complicated
- "zero users, zero thoughts"
- fifteen users allow you to find all usability problems
- five users allow you to find 85% of problems
  - add more users, learn less
- use your budget to run 3 tests with 5 users rather than 1 test with 15 users
  - iterative design and testing might uncover all remaining problems

where to start testing

test moderator
- grounding in basics of user-centered design
- quick learner, good memory, long attention span
- instant rapport with participants
- comfortable with ambiguity, flexible
- empathetic "people person"
- good communicator, organizer, coordinator

problems to avoid
- leading rather than enabling
- too involved with act of data collection
- acting too knowledgable
- too rigid with the test plan
- not relating well to each participant
- jumping to conclusions

limitations of testing
- testing is always an artificial situtation
- test results do not prove a product works
- participants are rarely fully representative of the target user population
- testing is not always the best technique to use




diary studies

longitudinal UX
- seek a holistic understanding of a persons particular activity across an extended period of time

looking back to CI
- what is the core of CI
  - direct observatio
  - what are some situations in which direct access is not possible
- we use think aloud to prompt users to talk in CI
  - if we are not in with the user, how do we prompt them?
  - diaries!

goal: ask people to observe and record their own actions. providing people with multiple ways of capturing data

situations in which direct user observation is not easy
- privacy sensitive tasks
- spontaneous tasks
- mobile situations
- restricted access situations
- tasks with high sampling rate

diaries
a diary is a document created by an individual who maintains regular recordings about events in their life, at the time those events occur
- physical diaries
- digital diaries
- shared/public diaries

types of diaries
- feedback diary
  - focus on events that interest researcher
  - users record data when events occur or thresholds are met
  - more accurate and objective
- elicitation diary
  - focus on events that are meaningful to user
  - users reflect on what happened in a later interview
  - more representative of users' feelings


  cultural probes
  - a way of capturing information in context

  when to use
  - users are...
    - on the move
    - experiencing events intermittently
    - in unpredictable environments
