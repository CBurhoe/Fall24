Review of Tuesday lecture
- Norman doors
  - poorly and unintuitively designed doors
  - we make push/pull decisions everyday
  - we all encounter doors that do this poorly
  - we all see signs that don't change how we act/behave

This course about process
- identifying problems with design
- understanfing user needs
- designing

what is a process?
- a way of doing something
- it must be
  - definable
  - repeatable
  - measurable
- it is a critical component of quality, along with customer satisfaction

process
- understand
- design
- develop
- test
==> quality

design starts with empathy

this is not a typical CS class
- designer vs developer
- we won't spend much time on learning developers languages
- we deal with user understanding
- ideation
- prototyping
- user eval
- rapid iteration and exploration

design paradigms and HCI history:

things from reading
- activity-centered design
- taskonomy vs taxonomy
  - taskonomy: arranging things around how we get our work done
  - taxonomy: system of classification
- we are concerned more with taskonomy
- UX design not equal to graphic design
- test with users
  - how can you get this information
- according to Norman good design
  - discoverability
  - feedback

ways of design:

appropriation
- a simple observation about some object to a different vision for how that object might be used to achieve a goal
- appropriation is the process by which people adopt and adapt technologies, fitting them into their working practices
e.g. Gmail as an online storage, or...

bricolage
- creating new things from a diverse range of other things
- something constructed or created from a diverse range of available things
- TV show MacGyver is an example of bricolage
- Apollo 13 is another example
- collaging

human-centered design
- an approach to problem solving in design
  - develops solutions by involving the human perspective
- understand users needs
- ideate and design
- test usability
- put rigor into design process

participatory design
- collaborative approach to design that involves users in the design process to create products, services and systems that meet their needs
- the goal is to create an egalitarian environment where users and designers work together to create products that are usable and have collective ownership
- users are designers

activity-based design (contextual inquiry)
- a type of ethnographic that involves in-depth observation and interviews
- it helps UX researchers understand how people work in the context of their natural environment
e.g. during a CI interview, a researcher will observe and interview users while they perform assigned tasks
e.g. google maps (what people need on the map when they travel)

value-sensitive design
- accounts for human values in a principled and comprehensive manner
- goal is to develop products that respect the values of the targeted end users
- identify those values early in the development process
e.g. privacy in social media, autonomy in healthcare, sustainable product design, fairness in algorithms

universal design
- empower people with diverse abilities
- create products, environments, and services accessible and usable by the widest range of people

ability-based design
- focuses on accomodating and leveraging the abilities of users rather than focusing on their limitations

universal vs ability based designs
- universal aims to create accessibility regardless of ability
  - creating one solution tht works for many
- ability aims at specific abilities of users and dyamically adapts them
  - adapts to users


HCI history:
- early on, highly trained people failing to effectively control the machinery they operate (e.g. airline pilots crashing planes)
- moves to information systems
- late stage, computer-human interaction and antecedents
- the most profound technologies are those that disappear

the 40s
- memex, 1945
  - stores records/articles/communications
  - items retrieved by indexing, keywords
  - information linked through associative trails

the 60s
- sketchpad, 1963
- the mouse, 1968

the 70s
- xerox alto, 1973
  - the desktop metaphor
- apple II, 1977
  - first mass production
  - color graphics

the 80s
- graphical interfaces (GUIs)
- knowledge navigator
- 3d pressure sensing multi-touch interfaces

the 90s
- AT&T visions of the future

modern
- chemical haptics in VR (UChicago)
