BCI definition:
  - building of a system that acts as direct channel between human mind/brain and a computer to
    - assist, restoring sensory behavioral capacity
    - transmit sensory info to brain, monitor
    - activating sensory integration
      - PFC -> mood regulation
    - manipulate brain states


cognitive augmentation
  - digital divide
  - individuality




5 neurorights:

1. personal identity
  - manipulation of the self
  - 

2. free will
  - autonomy
  - agency
  - volitional action

3. mental privacy
  - consent to data use
  - what is collected
  - why it is collected
  - capacity to delete

4. equal access to mental augmentation
  - availability to all

5. protection from algorithmic bias
  - discriminating against groups of people
