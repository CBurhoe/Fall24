levels of control

1. full automatic control
  - no human operator
  - problems not about human behavior but of machine production and maintenance
2. automatic control w/ human monitoring
  - human can take over in emergency
  - main task of human: monitor, maintain, calibrate machine
3. semiauto control w/ human operator performing critical functions
  - machine performs major work
  - human performs high-level mental functions (reasoning, judgment, planning, decision-making)
4. no automatic control, only information presenting to the human operator
  - human operator performs all tasks

inconsistency across definitions of autonomy

ironies of automation
- the set of unintended consequences as a result of automation that could detrimentally affect human performance on critical tasks
- automation might increase human performance issues, instead of eliminate them
- if the goal is to prevent human performance issues, 'design out' the potential for human failure at the start
- but we want improvements in safety and efficiency

irony 1: designers are also human
  - designers can introduce errors leading to system defects

irony 2: tasks not automated rely on humans
  - designers can leave a random collection of tasks to human input leading to incoherence

irony 3: the human may have to 'take over' if the system fails
  - designers can create a monitoring role not easily understood and accessible

irony 4: retrofitting automation can add complexity
  - designers can add a set of features creating confusions

irony 5: once competent, now no longer
  - designers can create highly-automated systems requiring new skill sets
