  - understand context, logic, process
    - decision making

  - truth of process -> scientific process, legal process
  - persuasion, agency
  - reproducability -> enable auditing

Question 2: how did explainability come about?

DARPA - 3 challenges to R&D
  - XAI
    1. more XAI -> new ML techniques (scientific question)
    2. design X interfaces -> human factor integration
    3. effective explanations 
      - decomposable
