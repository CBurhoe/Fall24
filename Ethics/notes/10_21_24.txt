Social Robots

Example:

Hanson Robotics - Sophia

Begs the question...
Should we create systems in our likeness?
  - create psychological expectations
    - if a system looks and behaves like us, shouldn't we treat them like us?
  - how do we treat each other?
  - how do they integrate into the legal system?
  - what role do these systems take in society?
    - equivalent to humans? analogues?

More examples:

Hiroshi Ishigura @ Osaka University Intelligent Robotics Laboratory - Erica - Japanese competitor to Sophia
  - most advanced humanoid robot system to date
  - ~15 years old
  - taking roles in movies, news anchoring, etc.
  - widely accepted reception in Japan


Sony - aibo - robopets
  - uncanny valley

Robokind - Milo, Carver, Vela, etc
  - educational assistants


Question 1: What is a social robot?
  - human-like representation
  - animal-like
  - assistive (cartoon-like)

Question 2: What role is it trying to fulfill/what should it do?
  - "role in society" -> carries a set of expectations

Question 3: What type of interaction do we want?
  - should they interact with people?
  - should they interact with each other? only each other and not with humans?

Question 4: should we distinguish between what's used for scientific or therapeutic purposes vs commercial?

Defining Social Robots:

- need to make a distinction between a tangible, physical manifestation and a non-physical manifestation
- social components
  - interactive component
  - non-interactive component
  - emotion (detection, comprehension, portrayal)
  - speech
  - listener
  - bodylanguage, gestures
- context
  - relational AI
    - leads to certain social dynamics
  - affective AI
    - emotionas

*note: autonomy in these systems is implied - able to act of own volition without requiring explicit human prompting


Why make these?
1. workforce
  - replace human for tasks
  - companion to human
  - complement human in tasks
  - surveil/monitor human
2. (-) cost, (+) productivity
3. entertainment
4. dull, dirty, and dangerous environments


report on affective AI computing - tasks
- sense signals and process data related to emotion
- find patterns and correlations between emotion and physiological responses
- recognize outward expressions associated with emotion, i.e. body language
- recognize overt and covert emotions
- replicate an outside observer's perception and predictions about someone else's emotional states 
  using everything the observer knows including context
- recognize or influence the emotion a person feels, both short term like happiness
  or sadness and longer term states like depression or anxiety
- recognize or influence other affective states including interest, engagement, or alertness
- measure levels of arousal and negativity/positivity rather than describe a specific emotion
- simulate emotion or expressions of emotion, e.g. social robot with gestures meant to convey situationally appropriate emotional responses

ethical issues
- bias, discrimination
  - FRTs already fail to recognize certain populations- the stakes are potentially even higher with affective robots
- accountability
  - should the user or the company be responsible for the results of usage of these systems
- transparency
- privacy and security
