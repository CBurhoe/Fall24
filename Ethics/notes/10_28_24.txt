    - monitoring
    - interrogation - probing for more info
  - info processing
  - info dissemination
  - invasion

challenges
  - bystanders privacy - record bystanders and their activities without their consent
    - solution - obtain consent to record ppl in public; wear tags on clothing; certain gestures - hard to implement in practice
  - re-identification and linkage - recognize an individuals identity from a data of daily activities
  - workplace adaptation - fear of employees being tracked by employers; safety of device in critical environments; 
    interference or distraction caused by device; recording sensitive info
  - self tracking - can lead to control but also obsession
  - data jurisdiction and privacy policy - from stringent surveillance laws to no data privacy laws at all; patchwork laws
