LAWS

7 risks of LAWS

1. unpredictability
  - unpredictable because of "black box"
  - but war is also unpredictable, why necessarily problematic?
  - humans and machines inherently different
  - errors, randomness, and expectation between machines and humans
    - humans
      - laws, LOAC
      - cognitive, emotions, social
      - real time problem solving
2. escalation of conflict
  - since LAWS have a greater capacity for harm, an error by LAWS would provoke escalation from other nations
    - retaliation
3. proliferation
  - if my enemy has LAWS, I need LAWS
  - akin to the nuclear arms race
  - also, with advancements in technology, LAWS become smaller, cheaper, easier to obtain and produce
  - obtainable by non-nation states
4. lowering of barrier to conflict
  - enabler of violence
5. mass destruction
  - quantity of people who can be harmed
  - and level of harm, severity
6. selective targeting
  - inability to precisely and accurately discriminate targets
  - could be abused by actors to cause indiscriminate killing
7. AI arms race

interoperability
- between nations collaborating against an enemy
