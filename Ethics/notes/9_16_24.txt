Human centered design:

physical principles (physical ergonomics)
- consider biomechanics
- comfort
psychological principles (cognitive ergonomics)
- behavior
- abilities
- limitations

modern HCI problems
- rise of the non-professional (lay) user
  - untrained in sys operation
  - no technical understanding of automation
  - no understanding of system limitations and vulnerabilities, risks
- naive understanding of automation
  - automated systems take over execution of tasks from humans
  - less amount of work, less attention needed from humans
  - misplacing trust in the system 
- global competition
  - industry - major players, monopolies, SMEs
  - "arms race" between nations, tool to wield power, not just economic development, more complex situations, more data,
    more knowledge to advance a posture of advantage
