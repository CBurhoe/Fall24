Awad et al. 2018
global preferences
  - prefer sparing humans over animals
  - prefer to spare more lives
  - prefer to spare younger lives
- German ethical guidelines for automated and connected driving
  - states that human life should be preserved over other animal life in dilemmas
  - ambiguous on question of sacrificing the few to save the many
  - very clear about not discriminately saving lives based on personal features such as age
individual variations
- not greatly significant, other than stronger affinity towards a decision vs more variation
culutural clusters
- Southern cluster much more likely to spare young rather than old, eastern cluster opposite
  - same for sparing higher status characters
- southern cluster has much weaker preference for sparing humans over pets than other two clusters
- all in agreement on sparing pedestrians (weak) and the lawful (moderate)
- southern cluster strong preference for sparing women and fit people
country level predictors
- countries closer in culture play the Moral Machine game more similarly
- individualistic cultures, emphasizing the distinct value of each individual, prefer sparing the greater number of characters
- collectivistic cultures, which emphasize respecting elders in a community, have a weaker preference for sparing younger people
- economic prosperity and quality of rules and institution correlate with a stronger preference against sparing the illegally crossing pedestrian
- countries with higher economic inequality correlate with a greater difference in the treatment of characters of different social status
- differential treatment of male and female characters in the MM correspond to country level gender gap in health and survival

Ryan Held & Yang 2024
- fine tuning phase of LLM training in which developers have a much higher degree of control over the behavior and character of a chat bot
  - who will give feedback
  - what prompts/tasks are in domain
  - who will provide exemplar responses
  - i.e. whose preferences are we aligning LLMs with and whose preferences are we missing?
global representation
- alignment improves performance in all dialects but increases disparity between dialects
  - whenever changes to performance are significant (p<0.05), alignment steps increase US English performance much mroe significantly than other global English dialects
  - before alignment, all base models perform about the same across dialects
  - Supervised Fine Tuning improves performance across the board, bu for Indian English the least, Nigerian English second, and American English the most
  - Preference Training shows weaker differences, but still suggests an improvement to the disparity between US English and other dialects
global representation: languages
- alignment for English can improve multilingual performance
  - for reading comprehension, alignment for English produces significant improvements across most languages, and no significant decreases in performance
