electrophysiology: MEG
- tracks magnetic fields generated by electrical currents arrociated with neural activity (ERF)
- SQUIDS
  - superconducting quantum interference devices
- better spatial res than EEG
- ms level temporal resolution
- only sensitive to neural activity in sulci but not gyri


transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
- electrical currents flow around the two circular components of a figure-8 coil and summate at their point of intersection
- this creates a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the plane of the coil
- magnetic field penetrates the skul and rapidly alters the electrophysiological properties of the underlying cortical neurons
- temporal res: ms
- spatial res: mm

e.g. Gough et al., 2005
- participants saw 2 letter strings and had to decide if they meant the same (e.g. idea-notion), sounded the same (e.g. nose-knows), or looked the same (e.g. fwtsp-fwtsp)\
- three TMS pulses were delivered to either the rostral (anterior) or caudal (posterior) LIFG (left inferior frontal gyrus) on 40% of the trials
- semantic judgements were delayed by TMS at the rostral site but not at the caudal site
- phonological judgements were delayed by TMS at the caudal site but not at the rostral site
- visual judgements were unaffected by TMS at either site



aphasia
acquired language deficit due to brain damage
- normal speech acquisition and development for age
- disrupted after damage
can affect production, comprehension, or repitition
- not:
  - language disturbance with a congenital cause
  - purely auditory deficits
  - purely articulatory deficits
  - confusion or psychotic states

- 25-40% of stroke survivors develop aphasia
- ~1mill people in US have aphasia
- ~100k new cases each year


historical background
- Paul Broca (1824-80)
  - attributed speech production deficits to damage in left inferior frontal gyrus (areas 44,45)
- Carl Wernicke (1848-1905)
  - attributed speech comprehension deficits to damage in posterior superior temporal gyrus (areas 22,42,+)

led to Broca's aphasia and Wernicke's aphasia

aphasia classification
- syndrome: a set of symptoms that tend to co-occur and that usually arise from damage to a particular brain region or network of regions
- Boston school of aphasia:
  - Broca's
  - Wernicke's
  - conduction
  - global
  - anomic
  - transcortical motor
  - transcortical sensory
  - mixed transcortical
- "house" model of the neural architecture of language originally proposed by Wernicke and Lichtheim 1880s, and Geschwind 1960s

criteria for distinguishing between syndromes are quite general:
- production
- comprehension
- repitition

- each syndrome depends on specific symptoms being either present or absent but impairments tend to be matters of degree rather that all or nothing
- each syndrome is a collection of symptoms that tend to co-occur, but not every symtpom must be present in order for a patient to meet a diagnosis
- each syndrome typically involes a close connection between a set of behavioral deficits and damage to a particular brain region or network of regions
  but these deficit-lesion correlations are sometimes violated
- the syndromes are not necessarily stable over time, and two syndromes can blend into each other over the course of a patient's recovery
