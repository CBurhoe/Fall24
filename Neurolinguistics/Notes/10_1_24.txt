written language (cont.)

last time: cognitive model of reading

reading
- reading aloud pseudowords like blicket requires the grapheme-phoneme conversion route
- reading aloud regular words like leg can be done by using either the grapheme-phoneme conversion route or a central route
- reading aloud irregular words like yacht ...


phonological dyslexia: worse on pseudowords than real words

surface dyslexia: worse on irregular words than on regular words and pseudowords

deep dyslexia: impaired on pseudowords as well as real words, with errors on the latter often being semantic
  in nature and worse for abstract items



reading: neural substrates

model most supported by literature:
1. visual form of written word processed in ventral occipitotemporal stream
2. access to pronunciation is enabled by complex perisylvian network
3. access to its meaning is enabled by a more inferior temporal-parietal-frontal network


many phonological dyslexics have damage in various parts of the perisylvian network and also manifest general speech processing
  deficits. those deficits presumably make it harder to read aloud pseudowords than real words
- however, some phonological dyslexics have normal speech processing apart from reading aloud pseudowords, and may have selective
  impairments of grapheme-phoneme conversion. their lesions tend to be in occipitotemporal areas or extrasylvian tempoparietal areas


many surface dyslexics have semantic dementia due to ATL atrophy
- some researchers have concluded that when reading aloud relatively uncommon words like yacht, we cannot pronounce them
  correctly unless we first retrieve their meaning
- however some patients with semantic deficits do not exhibit surface dyslexia, and a computer model suggests that surface dyslexia
  can result from damage to just the orthographic lexicon. so maybe for those SD patients with surface dyslexia, the atrophy
  has extended to the VWFA



writing: a cognitive model

- writing pseudowords like blicket requires the phoneme-grapheme conversion route

- writing regular words like leg can be done by using either phoneme-grapheme conversion route or a central
  route that includes the phonological and orthographic lexicons as well as the semantic system

- writing irregular words like yacht can only be done by using the central route, but there is controversy
  about whether the proper spelling of these words requires prior activation of their meaning


graphemic buffer
allographic conversion
graphomotor planning


phonological dysgraphia: worse on pseudowords than real words (damage in phoneme-grapheme conversion pathway)

surface dysgraphia: worse on irregular words (yacht -> "yot") than on regular words and pseudowords (damage in central route, uses P-G route to normalize spelling)

deep dysgraphia: impaired on pseudowords as well as real words, with errors on the latter often being semantic in nature
  and worse for abstract items


graphemic buffer impairment:
- transposition, substitution, omission, additon of letters
- errors tend to be in middle of word
- errors more frequent for long than short words
- errors occur relatively equally for pseudowords and real words
- errors occur in handwriting and oral spelling as well as across tasks like naming and delayed copying



different languages perform oral spelling differently depending on orthographic accuracy
e.g. english spells letter by letter

e.g. russian spells syllable by syllable

purcell et al.'s (2011b) meta-analysis of 11 PET and fMRI studies:
  - VWFA is engaged during both reading and writing, suggesting that it contains a single orthographic lexicon (...)


when ventral occipitotemporal (VWFA) damage disrupts writing, the impairment usually takes the form of surface dysgraphia
- many patients with semantic dementia also exhibit surface dysgraphia

some researchers have concluded that when we write relatively uncommon irregular words like yacht, we cannot spell them correctly unless we first
  retrieve their meanings
- however as with surface dyslexia, it could be that for those semantic dementia patients who exhibit surface dysgraphia, the atrophy
  has extended into the VWFA
