two aspects of inflection separated in the brain both spatially and temporally

morphosyntax

noun and verb inflection share a common pathway in Broca's (late, category neutral processing)

but noun and verb inflection can be differentially impaired by damage to separate regions of the brain (early, category specific processing)

noun specific regions not yet understood, but verb specific regions seem to include L MFG

double dissociation between noun and verb inflection

noun specific morphosyntactic circuitry for selecting features like singular vs plural
  - superior part of Broca's?

verb specific morphosyntactic circuitry for selecting features like present vs past tense
  - posterior part of L MFG?
  - shapiro et al., 2006

verb specific ...
  - anterior part of L MFG
  - finocchiaro et al., 2010


rTMS data
  - anterior MFG
