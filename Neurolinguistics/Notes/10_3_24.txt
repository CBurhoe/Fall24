lemma model of lexical selection and form encoding
- levelt, 2001
- cognitive architecture
- 


lexical selection:
  conceptual focusing
  perspective-taking
=> lexical concept
  lemma selection
=> lemma (abstract representation of a word)

lemma fed into...

form encoding:
  retriving morphemic phonological codes
=> phonological codes
  prosodification
  syllabification
=> phonological word
  phonetic encoding
=> articulatory score


1. lexical selection
- thought must be converted into an appropriate "lexical concept"- a semantic structure that constitutes the meaning of a word
- selection considerations
  - cross-linguistic variation: messages must be tuned to the target language
  - perspective: subjective construal; consideration of interlocutor's state of mind

- lexical concepts - unitary nodes that lack complex internal structure but may afford access to semantic features
  that "flesh out" the conceptual content of words
- several semantically related lexical concepts are co-activated in parallel
- the target - the node that is ultimately activated to a higher degree than the others


2. lemma selection
- once a lexical concept has been selected, it activates the corresponding lemma
- lemma - abstract word node that intervenes between semantics and phonology
- and points to various morpho-syntactic features


crossing the "rift" between lexical encoding and form encoding
- "tip of the tongue" states
- anomia


3. retrieve morphemic phonological codes
- two subprocesses
  - access morphemic representations
  - "spell out" segmental phonemic content
- only selected lemma activates the corresponding phonological code
- phonological code retrieval is influenced by frequency
  - high freq dog is retrieved faster than low freq broom
  - the effect is at the phonological level, since homonyms that differ in frequency (more/moor) are
    retrieved at the same rapid rate (moor is helped by more)

4. prosodification and syllabification
- syllabification is done incrementally on the fly
  - transcends morpheme boundaries: horses -> hor-ses
  - transcends word boundaries too: the last two words of "he'll escort us" are syllabified as e-scor-tus

5. phonetic encoding
- takes as input phonological representation that specifies the syllable boundaries of the item
- matches each unit in that representation with the corresponding node in the syllabary; 
  inventory of highly practices, precompiled syllabic gestures


self-monitoring
- underlies the capacity to detect and correct ones own speech errors
- two feedback loops are posited
  - external
    - monitors auditory signals of self-produced speech
  - internal
    - monitors the covert process of generating phonological words


neurobiological evidence: indefrey and levelt, 2004
- meta-analysis of 82 brain mapping experiments that used any of the following tasks (table in slide 12)

stage 1: conceptual focusing & perspective taking
- evidence from semantic dementia, PET, fMRI, and TMS suggests that unitary lexical concept nodes may reside in the anterior temporal lobes
  bilaterally but with a mild left bias
- broca's area is critical for resolving conflicts between multiple co-activated lexical concepts and/or lemmas
- in healthy subjects and brain-damaged patients, this region is linked with greater word retrieval interference

stage 2: lemma selection
- [picture naming + associative word generation] MINUS [word reading + pseudoword reading]
damasio et al., 1996
- patients with naming impairment
- correlated lesions with word categories
  - categories: persons, animals, tools
  - areas: temporal pole, IT, IT+

gallegos & tranel, 2005
- 30 normal subjects
- 8 patients with L anterior temporal lobotomies
- 10 patients with R anterior temporal lobotomies
- pts: significantly lower accuracy than normal subjects
- happy faces named significantly faster than neutral for all groups

stage 3: retrieving morphemic phonological codes
- [picture naming + associative word generation + word reading] MINUS [pseudoword reading]
- left posterior STG/STS/MTG exhibits word frequency effects
- damage causes wernickes aphasia, hence phonological paraphasias and neologisms
- degeneration found in logopenic progressive aphasia, which also involves phonological paraphasias

corina et al., 2010
- picture naming
- regions where direct electrical stimulation induces phonological paraphasias or neologisms
