contributions of aSTG

- dronkers et al., 2004
  - aSTG essential for basic syntactic processing
    e.g. grouping words into hierarchically organized phrases and clauses

- hickock & poeppel., 2007
  - immediately inferior region aSTS/aMTG
(see slides)

- obleser et al., 2011
  - auditorily presented german sentences
  - 3 versions: same words, different syntactic complexity
    - low
    - medium
    - high
  - as syntactic complexity increased, so did activation in the aSTG near the boundary between BA22 and BA38
  - similar complexity effects also found in BA44 and pSTS

- brennan et al., 2012
  - listen to segment of Alice in Wonderland
  - look for correlations between BOLD signals and two linguistic variables:
    - frequency of each open-class word
    - the number of syntactic structure building operations required by each word
  - significant correlations between BOLD signals and the syntactic metric emerged in only one region- the aSTG near the boundayr between BA22 and BA38
  - several other fMRI studies reported aSTG sensitivity to violations of syntactic structure
  - aSTG appears to house neural mechanisms involved in resolving a conflict arising when a word is encountered
    whose grammatical specifications are incompatible with the syntactic structure that has already been built up
  - aSTG operates in concert with BA 44 (broca's area)

- humphries et al., 2006: 
  - fMRI study with four conditions
    - congruent sentences
    - congruent word lists
    - random sentences
    - random word lists
  - difference between congruent and random sentences: congurent sentence has semantic meaning at the sentence level, random sentence does not
  - lateral ATL exhibited a main effect of syntactic structure, a main effect of semantic structure, and an interaction between the two
  - support combinatorial network hypothesis

- patients with SD suffer from atrophy in ATL, yet retain their appreciation of most grammatical rules until very late stage illness

ogar et al., 2011
  - administered CYCLE-R to a group of wernicke's aphasics and a group of SD patients
  - found that wernicke's aphasics severely impaired, SD patients performed quite well


kho et al., 2008
  - surgical removal of ATL does not significantly impair sentence comprehension

breedin & saffran, 1999
  - SD patient
  - couldn't distinguish between "pig" and "cow" in single word comprehension tasks
  - but was able to after seeing a picture of a pig chasing a cow and then hearing "the cow is being chased by the pig"
  - contrary to findings of dronkers et al., 2004
  - unsure of whether the relevant sectors of ATL (aSTG, aSTS, aMTG, BA38) are or are not necessary for sentence comprehension


contributions of aSTS/BA39

dronkers et al., 2004
  - storage component of auditory-verbal short-term memory (STM)

hickok & poeppel, 2007
  - ditto
  - also rehearsal component relies on the articulatory network and the two components interact via sensorimotor interface
  - other evidence suggests that the pSTS/BA39 essential for linking NPs with participant roles in "hard to understand" sentences
    - sentences which are semantically reversable & syntactically noncanonical


aSTS/BA39: auditory-verbal STM & sentence comprehension

- digit span correlates with amount of gray matter in pSTS
- patients with significantly reduced digit span have greatest lesion overlap in pSTS/pSTG

leff et al., 2009
  - 210 stroke patients
  - for each voxel in each patient, determine probability that it had normal gray matter, white matter, lesioned brain, non-lesioned brain 

  - administered a variety of tasks 
    - digit span to probe STM capacity
    - several lexical tasks
      - word and pseudoword recognition
      - picture naming
      - verbal fluency
    - auditory and written sentence comprehension tasks

  - lesion correlates of reduced digit span taken as sole behavioral factor
  - lesion correlates of reduced digit span with performance on the other lexical tasks factored out
  - as gray matter density in pSTS/pSTG cluster declined, so did patients scores on both digit span tasks and 
    auditory sentence comprehension task
  - however no such correlation was found for written sentence comprehension task
  - there is an STM component in auditory sentence comprehension that is not present in written sentence comprehension tasks
  - but comprehension requirements stays the same, so isolates STM component

richardson et al., 2009: fMRI with 47 healthy subjects
  - focus on contrast between semantically reversible and nonreversible sentences
  - one "hot spot" centered at the temporoparietal boundary
  - importantly the very same region was also engaged during a task requiring auditory-verbal STM

  - similarly, newhart found that among stroke patients, impaired comprehension of sentences that were both
    semantically reversible and syntactically noncanonical was associated with hypoperfusion in BA39
    - same cases tended to have significantly reduced digit span

not all pts with auditory-verbal STM deficits have impaired sentence comprehension

butterworth et al., 1986
  - case could not hear words in her head
  - could nevertheless understand long complex sentences and make grammmatical judgements requiring an 
    appreciation of relationships between distantly separated words
  
such findings challenge the view that in order for syntactic processing to be successful, it is necessary for auditory-verbal STM to (...)

in addition, some pts have sentnece comprehension deficits that are independent of their auditory-verbal STM capabilities

damage to BA39 associated with worse performance on noncanonical sentences as opposed to canonical sentences
  - association remains valid even after factoring out STM scores

perhaps sectors of pSTS/BA39 contribute to auditory-verbal STM on the one hand, and determination of "whos doing what to whom" on the other


is broca's area necessary for sentence comprehension?
  - dronkers says no
  - thothathiri says no
  - papoutsi says yes
  - newhart says yes
  - kinno says yes
  - several PNFA studies say yes
