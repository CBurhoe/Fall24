Nouns:
  - person
  - place
  - thing


Object Nouns
  - specifically things (and to some degree people)
  - concrete nouns (as opposed to abstract or intangible nouns)


perceptual and motor features of object concepts: background
  - amodal symbolic model: concepts consist of abstract symbols that are represented in a semantic system completely
    separate from modality-specific systems for perception and action
    - e.g. banana = [fruit], [long], [curved], [yellow]
  - grounded cognition model (embodied cognition or simulation): concepts are anchored in modality-specific systems, s.t. 
    understanding word meanings involves activating high-level perceptual and motor representations



color features
  - neural substrates of color processing
    - V4 (lingual gyrus)
      - passive sensation
      - engaged when gazing at a garden
      - damage causes achromatopsia
    - V4 alpha (middle fusiform gyrus)
      - active perception
      - engaged when sorting colors
      - damage causes color agnosia


simmons et al., 2007:
  - color property verification
  - motor property verification
  - concept-only trial
  - localize color perception areas
  results
    - color processing: yellow = color > grayscale
      wheels in perceptiual task
    - word processing (color property verification task): purple = color > motor judgements in conceptual task
    - overlap: L mid-fusiform gyrus (V4-alpha)
  - consistent with grounded cognition model
  - could be due to explicit color imagery?
    - maybe, but no reason for that according to amodal symbolic model


shape features
  - neural substrates
    - ventral temporal (fusiform) cortex underlies perception of object shape, with adjacent areas for different categories
      - faces (FFA)
      - body parts
      - animals
      - tools
      - places (PPA)
      - printed words (VWFA)
    - many studies suggest that it also represents the shape features of object concepts again with adjacent areas responsible for diff categories


chao et al., 1999: picture naming and property verification ("forest animal?", "kitchen tool?"")

wheatley et al., 2005: adaptation (priming) effects suggest automatic word activation
  - word reading
    - celery giraffe
    - horse goat
    - camel camel
  - fast presentation (150ms for a word, 100ms ISI)
  - as semantic relatedness increases, activity evoked by second word decreases in lateral fusiform cortex
    - informally, a "caching" effect
  - supports grounded cognition model

shape features
  - shape features of the meanings of object nouns are captured by populations of neurons in the ventral temporal cortex that
    - not only overlap partially with those that subserve visual perception of the same features
    - but are also segregated according tto the semantic category

motion features
  - posterolateral temporal cortex underlies the perception of object motion, with adjacent areas for different categories
    - MT+ (anterior occipital, lateral occipital sulci)
      - passive perception of moving stimuli
      - damage causes akinetopsia
      - projects to pSTS & pMTG
  - some studies suggest that is also represents the motion of features of object concepts, again with adjacent areas for different categories


chao et al., 1999
  - picture naming
  - object noun property verification
  - pSTS & pMTG were engaged in (...)


Motor features
  - anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) and supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the ventral premotor cortex (vPMC) are essential for motor programming
    during tool use
  - schematic gestural representations how tools should be grasped and manipulated
  - activated when using, pantomiming, imagining, seeing, hearing a tool used
  - damage causes conceptual apraxia(?)

  - many studies suggest these regions also represent the motor features of object concepts, especially for tool nouns like
    hammer, screwdriver, knife
  - naming tools activates aIPS/SMG and vPMS more than naming animals
  - naming manipulable artifacts (key) > non-manipulable (balcony)
  - naming artifacts manipulated in a particular way (cup) > those with no particular way to manipulate (clock)
  - regions engaged within 150ms (too fast for imagination to be a factor)
  - in aIPS: simular manipulation (piano and keyboard) > similar function (match and lighter)

  processing the meaning of words for manipulable objects involves covertly simulating
    actions performed with those objects
  - but: apraxic patients can;t use tools correctly, but can name tools and retrieve semantic info abbout them
  - tool nouns normally trigger motor simulations, but simulations are not necessary to understand words?


auditory features
  - environmental sound processing involves pSTG/S, pMTG bilaterally

kiefer et al., 2008
  - listen to env sounds
  - LD (lexical decision) on words with auditory features (telephone) vs words without (cup)
  - lexical decision task, hence mostly automatic semantic processing
  - words with auditory features are proccessed in L pSTG/S, pMTG, overlapping with the area processing sounds of animals and tools
  - BOLD signal increases with rating of words audioty semantic featues
  - also damage to impairs processing of audiotry feature wrods more than non-AF words


gustatory and olfactory features
  - both depend on medial orbitofrontal cortex bulaterally

goldberg et al., 2006
  - the corresponding features of object concepts are also represented partly in that area


summary
  - overall considerable amoutn fo research supports the grounded cognition model
  - understanding object nouns involves accessing high level perceptual and motor representations that capture generalizations

semantic hub for object concepts
  - hub and spoke model
    - concepts based not only on modality specific brain systems for perception and action but also on modality invariant
      integrative mechanisms in the ATLs
    - combines aspects of the grounded cognition model and the amodal symbolic model

semantic hub needed because
  - feature from all modalities are not experience simultaneously 
  - features differ greatly in their typicality

semantic dementia
  - conceptual knowledge deteriorates gradually
  - patient EK (bright et al., 2008), 3 testing times over 2 years
    - atrophy begins in TP bilaterally, spreads posteriorly
    - performance on semantic tasks declines accordingly

lambdon ralph et al., 2010
  - 6 SD patients
  - hub and spoke model predicts that when ATL hub is damaged, "performance will become dominated by modality-specific surface
    similarities and be less reflective of higher-order semantic structure"
