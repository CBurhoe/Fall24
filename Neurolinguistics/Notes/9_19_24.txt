primary progressive aphasia
- acquired language deficit (aphasia) that is due to a neurodegenerative disease

three main PPA syndromes
- progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)
- semantic dementia (SD)
- logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA)

often related to frontotemporal dementia (FTD)
- FTD - 2.7-15.0 per 100,000
- 20-40% of FTD cases have PPA
- average age of onset in late 50s
- average survival rate of ~7 years
- PPA first described in late 1800s but wasn't systematically studied until late 1900s



progressive nonfluent aphasia
- production
  - nonfluent
  - hesitant
  - agrammatic, often with phonological disturbances and/or apraxia of speech
- comprehension
  - mostly intact for single words and simple sentences
  - impaired for complex sentences
- repetition
  - impaired
- atrophy
  - (see slides)


semantic dementia
- production
  - fluent but with semantic errors
- comprehension
  - impaired
- repetition
  - intact
- atrophy
  - anterior temporal lobes bilaterally but emphasized in left hemisphere
  - posterior extension over time


logopenic progressive aphasia
- production
  - profound word-finding difficulties sometimes accompanied by phonemic paraphasias
- comprehension
  - mostly intact for single words and simple sentences
  - imapired for complex sentences
- repetition
  - usually normal for words but impaired for sentences
  - poor recall of sequences of digits, letters, words
- atrophy
  - wernicke's area
  - extends superiorly into supramarginal gyrus
  - posteriorly into angular gyrus
  - inferiorly into posterior middle temporal gyrus



speech perception

wernicke-lichtheim-geschwind model (house model) (see book for labels)
- two pathways from center for the "sound images" of words (A)
  - one to center for word meaning (B)
  - another to center for speech production (M)


dual stream model (hickok and poeppel, 2000, 2007)
- dorsal stream sound for articulation
- ventral stream sound for meaning
