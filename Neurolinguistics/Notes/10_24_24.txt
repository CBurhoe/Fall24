semantic hub

amodal model

grounded-cognition (embodied model)

hub and spoke model
  - particular parts of the brain that process types of stimuli are involved with processing words that are related to these characteristics or attributes
  - also modality-invariant integrative mechanisms in ATL

Lambon Ralph et al., 2010
  - normal boundary of "cat" category
  - amodal hub allows us to distinguish between closely related members of other categories (e.g. hyenas which are qudrapedal mammals)
  - reduced boundary of "cat" category concept determined by the atrophied ATL


Limitations of Hub-and-spoke model
  - hard to rule out undetected damage outside ATL (semantic hub)
  - not possible to determine differential contributions to conceptual processing of different parts of ATL


Semantic Hub: evidence from fMRI
  Binney et al., 2010
    - semantic judgement task: rogue: polka scoundrel gasket
      - choose synonym
    - two key parts of ATL: inferolateral and anterior fusiform
    - whole brain analysis
    - ROI comparison with semantic dementia and rTMS data
    - anterior fusiform gyrus most activated in normal subjects during semantic judgement task is also ATL region that happens to be most 
      atrophied in SD patients
    - due to sinus air-pockets, artifacts in fMRI data makes visualizing ATL regions difficult

 evidence from TMS 
  Lambon Ralph et al., 2010
    - rTMS to anterior ITG/MTG bilaterally
    - synonym judgement (experimental) and number judgement (control)
    - TMS to left or right temporal pole slows down synonym judgement, doesn't significantly affect number judgement
    - semantic hub depends on both left and right ATL

semantic hub summary
  - according to hub and spoke model, meanings of object nouns depend not only on modality specific systems for perception and action
    (spokes) but also on amodal integrative system that resides in ATL bilaterally (hub)
  - ATL hub has two main functions
(see slides)


Domains of Object Concepts
  - object concepts usually grouped together to form multilayered taxonomies
    physical objects
    living things
    etc


Animals
  Blundo et al., 2006
    - pt KC: 25 y/o female, 11 years of education
    - herpes simplex encephalitis damage
    - severe impairment on animal image naming relative to controls
      - intact for vegetable and artifact categories
    - impaired on oral definition of animals
      - intact for other categories
    - impaired on drawing animals from memory
    - etc.
    
Fruits & Veggies
  Samson & Pillon, 2003
    - Case RS: 64 y/o male
    - stroke damaged L ventral/medial temporal areas, some medial occipital areas, and part of the thalamus
    - impaired across tasks for fruits and veggies

Tools
  Warrington & McCarthy, 1987
    - Case YOT: 50 y/o female
    - stroke damaged L frontoparietal region
    - propositional language production and comprehension severely impaired
    - retained some ability to understand single words
    - intact for animals, fruits and veggies
      - spoken word picture matching on artifacts (objects) impaired for 2s RSI, intact for 5s RSI
      specifically, concepts themselves are intact, but retrieving those concepts is impaired
      - selective impairment of tool concept access
    - further selective impairment for accessing concepts of small manipulable artifacts (tools) but not large non-manipulable artifacts (non-tool objects)
    - YOT's knowledge retrieval deficit was significantly worse for tool-like than for non-tool-like objects

    - patterning of body parts with tools in other neuropsychological studies may reflect the fact that like tools, body parts are defined
      to some extent according to the semantic dimensions of function, action, and spatial relationships

summary:
  selective impairment to specific semantic categories is possible


differential weighting hypothesis
  - different domains of object concepts are characterized by different mixtures and "weightings" of modality-specific features,
    and this causes them to gravitate, over the course of cognitive development, toward different networks of brain regions
  - as a consequence, disrupting a particular region that is functionally more important for one conceptual Domain than for others
    may be sufficient to generate category-specific deficits
  challenges
  - some pts with category-specific deficits for living things have impairments for all types of knowledge - visual/perceptual as
    well as funcitonal/associative - about the affected concepts
  - even if a sensory/motor channel is important for a partiuclar category, it is not always impaired in pts with a deficit for that category
  - even if a sensory/motor channel is important for a particular category, damage to it is not always associated with a deficit for that category

distributed domain specific hypothesis
  - major factor driving the neural architecture of object concepts is domain, with the three most evolutionarily relevant
    domains- animals, fruits/veggies, and tools - being innately programmed
  - factor of domain shapes (see slides)

  Farah & Rabinowitz, 2003
    - Adam
    - suffered bilateral occipital and occipitotemporal lesions at one day of age
    - at 16, had impaired knowledge of living things, but intact knowledge of non-living things
    - implies that (see slides) representation of living vs non-living things in distinct neural substrates
    
    challenges
    - no evidence for an additional level of representation
    - if such level did exist, it woud constitute a this representational (see slides)

summary
  - see slides



Action Verbs

perceptual and motor features of action concepts
  - grounded cognition model says concepts are anchored in modality specific systems s.t. understanging word meanings involves 
    activating high-level perceptual and motor representations
  (see slides)
