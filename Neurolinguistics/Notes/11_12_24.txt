Sentence Comprehension

processing operations and resources

1. the reporter [who attacked the senator] admitted the error

2. the reporter [who the senator attacked] admitted the error

[] = embedded clause
"the reporter - admitted the error" = matrix clause 

- access lexical properties: as each word heard, phono, semantic, and grammatical properties must be accessed

- assemble constituent structures: based largely on their grammatical category specifications, the words must be
  grouped into hierarchically organized phrases and clauses

- link NPs with participant roles: based on both syntactic cues and the inherent argument structures of verbs, determine which NP
  is the actor and which NP is the undergoer of each clause

- short-term memory: keep linguistic material in activated state until the whole utterance has been understood

- cognitive control: deliberately reflect on the structure of the utterance to make sure it is processed correctly


Large scale neural network: anatomical organization

dronkers et al., 2004
  - 72 stroke patients
  - various impairment profiles across aphasic categories
  - brain regions where damage linked with sentence comprehension deficits
    - pMTG
    - aSTG
    - pSTS & BA39
    - BA47
    - BA46
  - the pMTG damage group also had sig worse scores than other groups on single word comprehension test in western aphasia battery
    - suggests pMTG necessary for accessing stored semantic and syntactic properties of words

turkens & dronkers, 2011: connectivity study
  - two measures of connectivity
    - structural: diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
    - functional: resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)

vigneau et al., 2006
  - meta-analysis of 36 functional neuroimaging studies of receptive sentence processing

pallier et al., 2011
  - in brain regions sensitive to size of syntactic constituents, neural response increases by one unit each time a new word incorporated into a phrase


functional considerations: pMTG
  - dronkers et al., 2004: pMTG maps phono forms of words onto semantic and syntactic featues
  - hickok and poeppel 2007: "lexical interface" of dual stream model of speech perception
  - may be the earliest stage of sentence comprehension

contributions of pMTG
  - snijders et al., 2009, fMRI
  - syntactically ambiguous conditions engaged pMGT more than the syntactically unambiguous conditions, suggesting
    that the pMTG represents the multiple syntactic frames triggered by words like bewijzen
  - lexically triggered syntactic frames must be kept active longer during the processing of real sentences than during processing of random strings of words
  - in sentence conditions, pMTG interacted with BA44/6 most likely via the arcuate fasciculus
    - pMTG represents competing syntactic frams
    - BA44/6 picks the most appropriate one
