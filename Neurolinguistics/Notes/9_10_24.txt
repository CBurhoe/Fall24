functional neuroimaging: experimental design

- block design
  - stimuli from same condition presented consecutively together
event related design
  - stimuli from one condition are randomly interspersed with stimuli from another condition
  - impossible for PET, possible/preferred for fMRI

data analysis
- subtraction paradigm
  - two conditions:
    experimental (A): requires ability of interest
    control (B): doesn't require that ability, but is equivalent in other ways
  - contrast activation map for experimental condition (A) against the one for the control condition (B) to reveal the brain areas underlying the ability of interest


complex version - conjunction analysis
  - two experimental conditions (A&B) and two matching control conditions (C&D)
  - first perform separate subtractions, then find the intersection of the outcomes: [(A-C) + (B-D)]
  resulting activation map


subtraction paradigm example: Narain et al. 2003
- intelligible vs unintelligible speech
- blocked fMRI
  A. speech
  B. noise-vocoded speech
  C. rotated speech
  D. rotated noise-vocoded speech
- intelligible speech (A&B)
- unintelligible speech (C&D)
- conjunction analysis: [(A - C) + (B - D)]


correlation paradigm
- does not treat ability of interest as all-or-nothing affair, but rather as a continuous cognitive dimension that can be manifested to varying degrees
- subjects perform tasks that recruit the ability of interest to different extents


e.g. Davis and Johnsrude's, 2003
- event related fMRI
- normal speech
- partly distorted speech: 3 types of distortion, each to 3 degrees
- completely distorted speech
- as intelligibility increases so does activation along the superior/middle temporal cortices


traditional approaches treat each voxel as an independent piece of data, using statistics to determine whether it responds 


multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)
- MVPA extracts the information contained in the pattern of activity across voxels
- this method can reveal whether two or more conditions can be distinguished from each other on the basis of the activity patterns in a set of voxels

e.g. Abrams et al. 2013
- event related fMRI
- 2 conditions: normal speech and rotated speech
- 2 analyses: subtraction (GLM) and MVPA
- MVPA searchlight strategy
  - for every voxel in the brain a 3x3x3 neighborhood is created
  - within that 27-voxel space, activity patterns evoked by the two conditions are analyzed to determine whether they are fundamentally different


electrophysiology
- stimulation
- recording

- intracranial
- extracranial


for patients with intractable epilepsy, neurosurgery is sometimes performed to identify and remove suspected epileptogenic area
- stimulation mapping is first used to estimate the functions of the regions exposed by the craniotomy
  - method first applied to a large number of patients by Wilder Penfield in mid 20th century

positive effects
- motor cortex: involuntary movement
- somatosensory: vague feelings
- visual: visual hallucinations
- auditory: auditory hallucinations
- higher-order temporal areas: experiential responses

negative effects (in language related regions)
- speech arrest
- anomia
- paraphasias


e.g. Ojemann et al., 1989
- stimulation
- 117 patients
- object naming task
- both anterior and posterior sites found in most cases
- some cases had only anterior or only posterior
- precise locations of anterior and posterior sites varied greatly across patients

e.g. Creutzfeldt et al. 1989
- single cell intracranial recording
- listening to words and repeating
- cell responds more to words with /k/, /g/ + /s/ or /r/

e.g. Flinker et al., 2011
- intracranial recording
- electrocorticography
  - local field potentials recorded from electrode grids placed directly over the cortex
- phonemes vs words


extracranial recording: ERP (EEG)
- ERP: event related potential
  - fluctuating waveforms recorded from scalp electrodes, time-locked with occurrence of experimental tasks
- EEG: electroencephalography
- temporal resolution: 1 ms
- very poor spatial resolution

multidimensional nature of ERPs:
- latency: time-point in ms post stimulus onset, when a particular deflection of the waveform either begins or reaches peak


e.g. Kutas & Hillyard, 1980
- N400 tracks the gradual buildup of semantic content during receptive sentence processing, such that its amplitude increases in proportion
  to the degree of difficulty of integrating the meanign of a word into the preceding context


MEG (magnetoencephalography)
- tracks magnetic fields generated by electrical currents associated with neural activity (ERF)
- SQUIDS
- ms level temporal resolution
- better spatial resolution than EEG
- but is sensitive to neural activity only in sulci, not gyri
