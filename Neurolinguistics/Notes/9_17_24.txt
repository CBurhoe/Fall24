aphasia (cont)

broca's aphasia (motor/expressive/nonfluent)
- production
  - nonfluent, sometimes with apraxia of speech and/or dysarthria
  - strong reliance on memorized formulaic expressions
  - worse retrieval of verbs than nouns
  - marked impairment of closed-class elements (function words)
  - reduced syntactic complexity
- comprehension
  - relatively preserved understanding of colloquial conversation
  - poor comprehension of some types of syntactically complex grammatical constructions
- repetition
  - disrupted, especially for multi-word sequences and closed-class items

morphemes: smallest part of language that carry meaning


wernicke's aphasia (sensory/receptive/fluent)
- production
  - fluent, sometimes excessively so
  - frequent phonemic paraphasias, which may be so sever as to constitute neologistic jargon
  - morphological and syntactic substitution errors sometimes occur
  - patients often unaware of their deficits
- comprehension
  - impaired for sentences, phrases, and in many cases even single words
- repitition
  - disrupted with errors involving word choice, phonological structure, and grammatical structure


conduction aphasia (associative)
- production
  - more fluent than broca's, less fluent than wernicke's
  - frequent phonemic paraphasias
  - recurrent attempts to correctly produce the sound structure of the desired expression
- comprehension
  - relatively preserved
  - difficulties may arise when confronted with long, complex sentences with high short-term memory demands
- repitition
  - disrupted for multi-word sequences and sometimes also for single words


global aphasia (mixed)
- production
  - severely impaired
- comprehension
  - severely impaired
- repitition
  - severely impaired


anomic aphasia (amnesic)
- production
  - fluent with hesitations
  - word-finding difficulties, sometimes category specific
- comprehension
  - relatively preserved
- repitition
  - relatively preserved


transcortical aphasias
- intact repition 
- deficits involving the mappings between the forms and meanings of utterances

3 types:

TCMA (transcortical motor aphasia)
- production
  - poor planning and initiation
- comprehension
  - relatively preserved
- repetition
  - good

TCSA (transcortical sensory aphasia)
- production
  - phonemic paraphasias
- comprehension
  - impaired
- repitition
  - good

MTCA (mixed transcortical aphasia)
- production
  - combination of the other two
- comprehension
  - imapaired
- repitition
  - good
