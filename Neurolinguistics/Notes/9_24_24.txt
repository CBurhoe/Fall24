bilateral organization

dual stream model
- ventral stream for processing sound for meaning
- dorsal stream for processing sound for action/speech

functional anatomical [] is hierarchical and bilateral

word deafness
- disorder in which speech perception is impaired
- intact hearing and sometimes intact recognition of non-speech sounds
- crucially, it usually requires bilateral lesions to the middle and posterior portions 
  of STG and underlying white matter, while often sparing Heschl's gyrus


organization is bilateral, but also assymmetric
- assymmetric sampling in time hypothesis
  - LH dominance for rapid changes ~20-80ms (phonemic contrasts)
  - RH dominance for slower changes ~150-300ms (syllabic contrasts)

Liebenthal et al. 2005
- discrimination of tokens along /ba/-/da/ continuum (phonetic) and continuum between
  /ba/-/da/ with inverted F1, F3 (non-phonetic)
- greater activation in left STS for phonetic vs non-phonetic discrimination


summary: early cortical stages
- early cortical stages of speech perception depend on a pathway projecting from the dorsal STG to the lateral STG/middle STS
- auditory processing along this pathway is organized hierarchically
  - dorsal STG: elementary spectrotemporal analyses
  - lateral STG and middle STS: extraction of increasingly complex phonological patterns
auditory processing along this pathway is also organized bilaterally
  - LH dominance for phonemic info 20-80ms range
  - RH dominance for syllabic info 150-300ms range




comprehension & repetition: double dissociation

Miceli et al. 1980
- impaired comprehension but intact repetition
  - transcortical sensory aphasia
- intact comprehension but impaired repetition
  - conduction aphasia
  - logopenic progressive aphasia
- impaired comprehension but intact phoneme discrimination (monitoring)
- intact comprehension but impaired phoneme discrimination (monitoring)



ventral stream: "what" - sound to meaning

- lexical interface (bilateral pMTG and pITG): maps phonological structures onto semantic structures
- combinatorial network (left lateral ATL): contirbutes to integration of sentence meaning


Boatman, 2000
- electrical stimulation in six patients
  - syllable discrimination
  - word and sentence repetition
  - sentence comprehension
  - spontaneous speech
  - oral reading of words
  - oral reading of paragraphs
  - oral object naming
- 29 sites where stimulation induced TcSA (transcortical sensory aphasia)
  - intact syllable discrimination
  - intact word and sentence repetition
  - impaired sentence comprehension
  - fluent but paraphasic production at 19 of 29 critical sites
- 10/29 sites where TcSA was induced but with intact naming
  - suggesting impaired mapping of sound to meaning
  - but normal mapping of meaning to sound


Dronker et al., 2004
- 64 chronic stroke patients with LH lesions, 46 (72%)- aphasic
- sentence picture matching task with 11 increasingly difficult sentence types
  - most severe and pervasive deficits found in patients with lesions centered in the left pMTG
  - the same patients also failed a separate test of single word comprehension, suggesting that the left pMTG plays a key role in understanding the meaning of words
- Left pMTG - intermediary between the phonological and semantic structures of words as maintained by the dual stream model


narain et al. 2003
- intelligible vs unintelligible speech

abrams et al. 2013
- intelligible vs unintelligible speech

davis and johnsrude's, 2003
- normal, partially, and completely distorted speech
- left lateral ATL responds more strongly to intelligible sound


Rogalsky & hickock, 2009
- ATL localizer task: passive listening to sentences > passive listening to noun lists
- semantic task: detect semantic anomalies
- syntactic task: detect syntactic anomalies
- 80% of sentecnes were correct and identical in the two tasks
- only a few voxels in the ATL had a task preference (semantic > syntactic)



dorsal stream: "how" - sound to action

- sonsorimotor interface (left Spt [sylvian parietal temporal]): maps phonological structures onto motor representations
- articulatory network (left posterior frontal lobe): essential for speech production


area Spt: Sylvian-parietal-temporal
- area Spt resides in the posterior portion of the planum temporale (PT)
- straddles at least four different cytoarchitectonic fields


sensorimotor network (Spt):

Hickok et al. 2003
- 3s auditory stimulation (speech or tune)
- 15s covert rehearsal (speech or humming)
- 3s auditory stimulation
- 15s rest
- area Spt engaged during auditory stimulation
- and to a lesser degree during covert rehearsal
- middle STG engaged during only auditory stimulation
- Spt - sensorimotor interface not only for speech, but for do-able oral sounds


conduction aphasia:
- results from damage to the left supramarginal gyrus and inferiorly adjacent tissue including Spt
- comprehension is mostly intact because lesion spares the ventral stream
- phonemic paraphasias are rampant (especially for long complex low-frequency words) because the motor programming of words can no longer be guided via area Spt
  by the sound-based representations that specify the auditory "targets" of production
- repetition severely impaired because it depends critically on area Spt, the neural relay station that translates what one hears
  into how to say it


logopenic progressive aphasia:
- atrophy generally includes Spt
- similar set of symptoms, but milder


buchsbaum et al. 2003
- compareison of 14 conduction aphasics & 105 healthy subjects
- Spt - region of maximal overlap between lesions and active normal areas


auditory-verbal short term memory (phonological loop)
- perception of an utterance activates sound-based representations in the phonological network
- these representations are kept "alive" by means of corresponding subvocal motor processes in the articulatory network
- this reverberatory cycle is mediated by the sensorimotor interface
- thus, auditory-verbal STM depends on the dorsal stream


articulatory network in L post. frontal lobe: D'Ausilio et al., 2009: TMS
- task: distinguish between 4 speech sounds presented in background noise
  - two labial: /ba/ vs /pa/
  - two dental: /da/ vs /ta/
- results:
  - TMS to LipsM1 sped up reaction times for labial sounds
  - TMS to TongueM1 sped up reactions times for dental sounds



Pulvermueller et al., 2006
- articulatory network is also engaged in a somatotopic manner during passive perception

although articulatory network might modulate speech perception in various ways, it is probably not a necessary resource for comprehension
  - large left frontal lesions severely impair production but not comprehension
  - deactivating the entire left hemisphere leads ot the same outcome
  - failure ot develop speech production does not preclude normal receptive speech development
  - infants as young as 1 -month old exhibit sophisticated speech perception ability, including categorical perception
    well before they acquire the ability to speak
