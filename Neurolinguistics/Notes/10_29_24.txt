Motor features

start at slide 55

while we normally activate motor features when processing action verbs, it may not be necessary
  - to understand a verb, not necessary to actually simulate it
  - consistent with the fact that we can at least partially understant descriptions of actions which we can't perform ourselves

fault tolerant theory of conceptual knowledge
  - as a person's capacity to mentally simulate actions decreases, ability to understant linguistic descriptions of actions does not
    suddenly disappear, but gradually degrades
  - e.g. I can appreciate what piano playing is like, but I don't have the same degree of understanding that a concert pianist does
    - I can visualize a pianist performing, but I can't simulate myself performing with high acuity
  - brain damaged patients who can't perform still have some understanding conceptually

summary on slide 57

motion features - what an object does
  - e.g. a bunny hopping
  - relies at least in part on L PLTC
motor features - what we do
  - e.g. petting a bunny
  - relies at least partially on 



semantic hub for action concepts
  - amodal symbolic hub in ATL
  - modality specific spokes in motion and motor regions

several studies report that meanings of action verbs deteriorate in SD patients 
  - manifested across a wide range of tasks

evidence that action concepts depends on ATLs
  - so far all come from SD patients

3000 english verbs in roughly 50 classes and 200 subclasses
  - verbs as putting; verbs as removing; etc


transitive and intransitive verbs

transitive verbs
  - actor and undergoer of action
    - the woman [actor] kissed [action] the mailman [undergoer]

intransitive verbs
  - only an actor OR an undergoer
    - the mailman [actor] bolted [action]
    - the mailman [undergoer] blushed [action]

transitivity is a lexical rather than a real-world property
  - bill ate the lasagna - bill ate
  - bill devoured the lasagna - *bill devoured
  - *bill dined the lasagna - bill dined

  "ate", "devoured", "dined" all in "consume" class, but each have different transitivity

transitive verbs depends more than instransitive verbs on certain temporal and parietal regions
  - transitive verbs engage angular gyrus and posterior supramarginal gyrus (BA 39 and 40) more than intransitive
  - transitive verbs engage frontal, temporal, and parietal regions more than intransitive

  extent of voxels in and near intraparietal sulcus may be due to perception of object-directed actions
  cluster including angular gyrus, PLTC, and lateral occipital cortex

understanding energy flow and causal relations between the two core participants in transitive sentences is especially
  important when both participants are animate
  - portion of PLTC that extends into angular gyrus engaged more when both participants are animate than when only one is animate
    - implies more cognitively intensive when differentiating the causal relation
  - as predicted, damage to this cortical territory impairs comprehension of these kinds of sentences

studies suggest that Broca's area is vital for processing action concepts
  - especially BA 44 seems to contribute more to processing transitive than intransitive verbs
  - agrammatic aphasics have more trouble producing transitive than intransitive verbs
    - lesions often affect Broca's area
  - hypothesis: Broca's area contributes more to transitive than intransitive verbs/sentences because it is essential for
    understanding the spatiotemporal organization of the kinds of volitional goal-oriented actions that transitive verbs consist of

  lesions in BA44 selectively impairs comprehension of object directed human actions, preserving nonhuman physical events

abstract words

start slide 76

dual coding model
  - word meanings based on both modality-specific (nonverbal codes) and lexical associations (verbal codes)
  - concrete concepts draw equally on both systems
  - abstract concepts rely primarily on verbal system (lexical associations)

evidence
  - concreteness effects
    - recognize concrete words faster and better than abstract words

also proposed
  - experiential system
  - distributional system

context availability model
  - all word meanings are amodal in format but differ with regard to how hard they are to interpret
  - concrete concepts tend to be fairly stable and insensitive to context
  - abstract concepts tend to be more variable and sensitive to context

  evidence
    - abstract words
      - appear in a wider range of linguistic contexts on diverse topics
      - have a larger number of distinct sense and meanings
      - recognized and understood just as efficietly as concrete words when a conceptually constraining context is provided

ROIs
  concrete > abstract
  - L fusiform
  - bilateral posterior cingulate
  - left angular gyrus
  generally more consistent with dual coding model than context availability model

  abstract > concrete
  - left middle/superior ATL
  - Broca's area
  could be consistent with either proposed model depending on interpretation


role of Broca's area in understanding abstract words
  - stroke patients (damage max overlap in Broca's area) worse overall for abstract than for concrete words
  - but accuracy for abstract words was significantly boosted by relevant contextual cues compared to no cues
  - irrelevant contextual cues had only minor negative impact on comprehension of abstract words
    but had major one on comprehension of concrete words
  - concrete words are less able to accomodate competing information because their meanings are more rigid?
  - results suggest that Broca's area helps us understand abstract words by finding the right interpretation when cues aren't present
  supports the context availability model

  - healthy subjects with TMS to Broca's area slower overall for abstract than concrete words
  - TMS slowed down reaction times for abstract (but not concrete words) EVEN MORE when relevant contextual
    cues were NOT provided
  - TMS did not affect concrete words (with or without context) or abstract words when context was provided
  - TMS effect on abstract words could not be due to their being "hard" since no effect occurred for hard number control condition
  supports context availability model


summary on slide 83


semantic hub for abstract concepts

L middle/superior ATL engaged more for abstract than concrete words

some SD and HSE patients display "reverse concreteness effects"
  - much better performance for abstract words than concrete words
  inconsistent with normal concreteness effects
  inconsistent with findings that abstract words depend more than concrete words on left ATL (which is damaged in both SD and HSE)
