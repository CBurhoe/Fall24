lemma model not a neuroarchitectural model

stage 5: prosodification and syllabification
- intersection analysis including all word production experimenets with over and covert responses and silent control conditions
- plus
  - SMA
  - Cerebellum
  - thalamus
  - midbrain
- self monitoring
  - external feedback loop: intersection analysis including studeis that employed overt word production tasks (which involve 
    hearing ones own voice) and studies that emploed auditory word perception tasks

challenges with the lemma model
- some brain-damaged pts make semantic errors in just one modality of output
  - how can these dissociations be accommodated
- discreet vs interactive processing


DIVA model of speech motor control
- computational framework of speech motor control
- starts where lemma model left off - phonetic coding and articulation
- more detaiks of feedback mechanisms 


located in posterior inferior frontla gyrus


articulator velocity and position maps
- ventral primary motor cortex; somatotopically mapped
- represent articulatory "score"
- damage causes spastic dysarthria (severe if bilateral lesions)
- stimulation cause speech arrest
- engaged during both production and perception

initiation map
- SMA (supplementary bimodal area) bilaterally
- each unit in SSM (speech sound map) has a cerresponding unit in the initiation map, and all of these units project to AV&PM
- IM provides a "go" signal that causes a fully prepared speech motor pattern to be put into action
- damage causes akinetic mutism of a form of transcortical motor aphasis
- stimulation causes speech arrest or involuntary vocalizations

auditory feedback control
- ssm activates auditory target map
- actual auditory feedback activates auditory state map
- the expected and actual auditory feedbacks as compared by the auditory error map:
  - units corresponging to the expected feedback are inhibited by the target map
  - units corresponding to the actual feedback are excited by the state map
  - units that end up inhibited or excited indicate error
- the error map projects to the feedback control map,


tourville et al, 2008
- read aloud one-syllable words
- 1/4 of trials have F1 of speakers auditory feedback is perturbed
- behavioral results
  - subjects compensated in speech production
fMRI results
- shift vs no-shift comparison: post STG, PT bilaterally

somatosensory feedback loop
- ssm activates the somatosensory target map, which represents the expected tactile/proprioceptive feedback
- actual feedbac activates the somatosensory state map
- expected and actual fedback are compared by the somatosensory error map:
  - units corresponding to ...(see slide 35)

golfinopolous et al, 2011
- read allwd two syllable pseudowords
- 1/7 trials balloon in mouth
- fMRI
  - perturbed vs unperturbed comparisons: bilateral SMG, R ventral PMC

need to know 
SSM left
articulator velocity and position maps
auditory feedback systems
- target map
- error map
- state map
somatosensory feedback loop (same three parts)



prosody
two main kinds
  - emotional
  - linguistic
two main proposals for cerebral lateralizations
  - prop 1: the key factor involves acoustic features
    - right lateralized
      - long duration
      - pitch variation
    left lateralized
      - short duration
      - temporal variation
  proposal 2:
    - right lateralized
      - emotional prosody
    - left lateralized
      - linguistic prosody
