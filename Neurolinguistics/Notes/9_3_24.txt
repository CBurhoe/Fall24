***brain mapping methods***


- neuropsychology
- functional neuroimaging (PET & fMRI)
- electrophysiology (EEG/ERP)
- transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
no ideal "brainscope", each method has advantages and disadvantages, and each has its ideal scope

neuropsychology:
- oldest method in cognitive neuroscience
- behavioral and lesion data from neuro patients
- use these data to determine
  - which mental abilities can be imapaired independently of others - cognitive architecture of language
  - which neural structures are necessary to support them - neural architecture of language

dissociations
  - single dissociation
    - patient A performs significantly worse on task X than on task Y
    - suggests that the lesions selectively disrupted some mental representations and/or computations that are required by task X but not by task Y
    - however, task X may just be a lot harder than task Y, and the lesion may have induced greater sensitivity to this difference in difficulty
  - double dissociation
    - patient A performs significantly worse on task X than on task Y; patient B performs significantly worse on task Y than on task X
    - reduces likelihood that either patient's performance may be due to differences in task difficulty
    - support view that each task requires at least some mental representations and/or computations that can be selectively disrupted

e.g. patient KSR (Rapp & Caramazza, 2002)
- noun vs verb
- spoken vs written
- homonyms
  - "give me the _fish_"
  - "I like to _fish_"

hypotheses:
A.
- semantic system
  - object concepts: "the fish"
  - action concepts: "to fish"
- modality
  - phonological output lexicon
  - orthographical output lexicon
B.
- semantic system
- phonological output lexicon
  - nouns
  - verbs
- orthographical output lexicon
  - nouns
  - verbs


case studies:
- difficult to make generalizations
- but can give a general idea of architecture models for further investigation
- useful for identifying unusual patterns of dissociation
group studies:
- useful for testing the reliability of deficit-lesion correlations
- but nature of deficit that is putatively shared by all the patients in a group must be specified as precisely as possible 
(note Caramazza's critique of syndrome-base approaches)


neuropsychology: visualization
- MRI
  - the protons in the hydrogen atoms of water molecules have randomly oriented spins
  - scanner creates a strong magnetic field that causes some of the protons to become aligned with it
  - a radio wave is then passed through the volume, causing the aligned protons to absorb some of this energy and shift their orientation by 90 degrees
  - when radio wave is turned off, protons release the energy as they "relax" back into alignment with the magnetic field of the scanner
  - this "relaxation" process generates the signals that are used to create brain images
  - different tissues like gray vs white matter have different densities of hydrogen and this leads to different relaxation rates of protons
  - spatial resolution of scans can be <1mm

types of brain damage:
- strokes: blood supply to particular part of the brain is cut off, depriving the downstream tissue of oxygen
  - ischemic (thrombotic or embolic): blood clot blocks a vessel
  - hemmhoragic: blood vessel ruptures, blood escapes into surrounding tissue
  - if blood flow not restored quickly, tissue will die, leaving a cavity that gets filled with CSF
  - results in focal lesions depend on the functions that are normally subserved by the affected regions
- TBI
  - closed head TBI: a sudden blow that damages the brain while leaving the skull intact
  - open head TBI: both brain and skull are penetrated by an object such as a bullet or shrapnel
- neurodegenerative and infectious diseases
  - progressive in nature and involve atrophy in specific regions or sets of regions of the brain
- tumors
  - masses of tissue that grow abnormally and serve no physiological purpose
  - most common - gliomas, originate in WM

voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
- measures relative concentrations of gray and white matter in particular areas
- VBM analyses can reveal the different distributions of significant cortical thinning in the three variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA)



behavioral vs lesion data:

lesion overlap and subtraction analysis
- recruit two groups of patients: one with deficit and another without
- for each group, superimpose the lesion sites and determine the degree of overlap at every voxel
- contrast overlap map for impaired patients against one for unimpaired patients to disclose the regions where damage is linked specifically to the deficit
e.g. Tranel & Kemmerer, 2004
  - all 4 tasks given to 78 patients
  - impaired group (N=6) failed all 4 tasks
  - unimpaired group (N=9) failed on only 1 task
  - contrasted lesion overlap map for the impaired group against the lesion overlap map for the unimpaired group
