agrammatism - 5 main symptoms
  - paucity of main verbs
  - syntactic simplification
  - omission of free-standing closed-class elements (i.e. functors)
    - "an apple" : an is a free-standing closed-class element -> omission becomes "apple"
  - substitution of bound closed-class elements (i.e. inflections)
    - "he walks": walk + -s : -s is a bound element -> could substitute to "he walking"
  - reliance on canonical word order
    - SVO in English (Subject - Verb - Object)

all of these symptoms dissociate from each other
  - Caramazza: "no grounds on which to support the claim that agrammatism constitutes a natural kind category representing those patients with deficit
    to a single, well-defined component of the language processing system (or even common and equivalent deficits to multiple components)"

model:
  message
  grammatical encoding
    1. functional    - word exchanges
      - lexical selection
      - function assignment
    2. positional    - stranding errors
      - constituent assembly
      - inflection 
  phonological encoding - sound errors


two operations at functional level
  - accessing argument structure properties associated with the lemmas of verbs
  - mapping participant roles onto grammatical relations

two main operations at the positional level
  - assembling hierarchical constituent
  - inserting free-standing and bound closed-class items in the proper place


accessing argument structure
  - berndt et al., 1997
    - 10 pts, 4 with V<N impairment (verb retrieval), single-word production tasks
    - in elicited narratives, impaired verb retrieval correlated with syntactic simplification
    - in constrained sentence production task, 2/4 verb impaired pts had trouble generating not only target verbs, but also the second noun
      - S = NP + VP = NP1 + V + NP2
      - 2/4 pts have difficulty with just the verb, not the nouns (only V impairment)
      - 2/4 pts have difficulty with the whole verb phrase (VP = V + NP2 impairment)
    - their performance for both verbs (V) and second nouns (NP2) improved when the verbs were provided
    - suggests that the problem involved accessing the argument structure (e.g. transitivity) at the functional level of syntactic encoding

  - schwarts et al., 1985 - reversal errors
    - attempts to describe a picture of a girl running toward a man with outstretched arms
    - attempts to describe a picture of a boy being hit on the head by a ball

assembling hierarchical constituents
  - some pts are deficient at generating syntactically complex expressions, but are nevertheless capable of supplying the correct
    closed-class elements

inserting closed-class items
  - some pts can still formulate sentences of normal complexity, but are deficient at providing the appropriate closed-class elements
  - nadeau & gonzalez rothi 1992
    - pt mean sentence length = 9.8 words (long sentences), 64% of his sentences contained embedded clauses
    - but he omitted
      - 43% of articles
      - 40% of complementizers
      - 43% of syntactically determined prepositions
      - 27% of semantically determined prepositions
      - 23 of conjunctions
      - 22% of auxiliary verbs
      - 20% of pronouns
      numerous errors involving verb and noun inflections

deficits involving positional level
  - the two main subtypes of closed-class elements - free standing functors and bound inflections - can be differentially disrupted
    - suggests further distinctions may need to be incorporated into theoretical model of the positional level
  - more fine grained double-dissociations between categories of closed-class elements have also been reported
    - e.g. syntactically vs semantically determined prepositions 
      - she called up her friend   she ran up the stairs
      - she called her friend up  *she ran the stairs up
      - *up her friend she called  up the stairs she ran

sentence production deficits in PPA
  - three vars
    - PNFA
      - impairment of grammar
      - atrophy in L ventrolateral PF region, including Brocas area
    - SD
      - impairment of conceptual knowledge
    - LPA
      - impairment of word retrieval 
  - PNFA most relevant to issues involving syntactic encoding
    - Patients have significant sentence production deficits.
    - Severity correlates with degree of cortical thinning in Brocaâ€™s area
      as well as the L posterior MFG and lateral PrCG

  - sapolsky et al., 2010
    - evaluated language capacity with PASS
    - relationship between PASS scores and regions of atrophy
    - significant correlation of thinning and degree of impairment in posterior part of brocas area, posterior MFG, and lateral PrCG 

  - wilson et al., 2010
    - PPA, bvFTD, 10 healthy controls
    - only PNFA - syntactic impairment
    - PNFA
      - lowest MLU (mean length of utterance)
      - most fragments
      - most syntactic errors
      - fewest embedded clauses
    - all PPA
      - more semantic errors than those with frontal temporal dementia bvFTD
    - lower syntactic scores - lower tissues volume in L posterior IFG and MFG

neuroimaging

- indefrey et al., 2001 and 2004, PET
  - restrictive scene description
  - training 1 week before scanning to learn how exactly to describe the scenes

  (S, sentence): The red square launches the blue ellipse
    - Das rote viereck stosst die blaue ellipse weg

  (NP, noun phrase): red square, blue ellipse, launch
    - rotes viereck, blaue ellipse, wegstossen
    need: agreement on adjective inflection
    don't need: articles, verb inflection (infinitive here)

  (W, words): square, red; ellipse, blue; launch
    - viereck, rot; ellpse, blau; wegstossen
    don't need any syntax encoding 

  - sentence condition engaged posterior broca's area significantly more than word condition
  - NP condition
    - 2004 NP~S (not significantly different)
    - 2001 NP < S (significantly different)
  
- haller et al., 2005, fMRI
  - sentence generation, word reading, sentence reading conditions
  - word reading = sentence reading
  - sentence generation - word reading
    - higher signal strength and greater cluster size in Broca's area
  - sentence generation - sentence reading
    - very similar to sentence generation - word reading

summary
  - serious methodological challenges restricting hemodynamic studies on neural substrates of syntactic encoding during sentence production
  - available data suggests syntactic encoding relies heavily on Broca's area, consistent with PNFA findings
  - still, none of the studies were designed to tease apart the two different levels of syntactic encoding - functional and positional levels
