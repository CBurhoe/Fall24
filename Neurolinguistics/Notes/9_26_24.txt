reading and writing: written language

rendering of linguistic messages as graphic markings
- arose ~5400 years ago
- logograms, syllabary, alphabet
- ~3 strokes per symbol (syllabary, alphabet)
- shapes of symbols are often the most common shapes in the natural world


local combination detector model: Dehaene et al., 2005
- neurally based framework for reading
- multiple leves of feature detectors
- increasing receptive field size of cells -> greater spatial coverage of letters and words
- increasing combinations of visual features -> greater complexity of representation
- hierarchy of coding
  

vinckier et al., 2007
- letter strings displayed for 100ms then ###### (mask)
- press button when mask appears
- types of stimuli
  - false font
  - infrequent letters
  - frequent letters
  - frequent bigrams
  - frequent quadrigrams
  - words
components of stimulus strings
  - features
  - letters
  - bigrams
  - quadrigrams
  - strings

vinckier et al., 2007
- six LH ROIs: as sites became more anterior, signals elicited by less word-like stimuli gradually dropped off
  whereas those elicited by more word-like stimuli stayed relatively strong
- six RH ROIs: no evidence for a similar hierarchy
- consistent with local combination detector (LCD), the perception of letter strings depends on a hierarchy of ventral occipitotemporal 
  regions, with increasingly complex combinations of features being detected at increasingly anterior levels of processing,
  and with greater lateralization toward the left hemisphere


VWFA (visual word form area)
- responds to printed words in the following ways
  - location invariant
  - case invariant
  - font invariant
  - sensitive to both consciously and unconsciously perceived words
  - more sensitive to real words than pseudo words
  - more sensitive to printed words than spoken words
  - equally sensitive to all familiar scripts
  - less sensitive to unfamiliar scripts
  - more sensitive to printed words than other categories of objects


szwed et al., 2007
- words and objects with 55% of contour retained
- matched on several variables
  - total contour length
  - number of vertices
  - height, width, luminance
  - recognizability
- factored out low-level visual processing by first contrasting word and object conditions against
  scrambled conditions
- then contrasted resulting activation map for words against one for objects


alexia: reading disorder with two subcategories
- patients who cannot recognize single letters, let alone complete words
- patients who cannot read whole words with just one quick glance, but must instead decipher each sequential letter
  in a slow and affortful manner and then put all pieces together
- alexic patients in second category often have damage in or near VWFA

gaillard et al., 2006
- 46 y/o male
- resection in L occipitotemporal cortex



neuronal recycling

paradox: reading and writing were created only around 5,400 years ago, and yet a single cortical region, VWFA,
  seems to be specialized for perceiving printer words

solution: Neuronal Recycling Hypothesis (Dehaene & Cohen, 2007)
  - human brain organization is subject to strong anatomical connectional constraints inherited
    from evolution. organized neural maps are present early on in infancy and bias subsequent learning
  - cultural acquisitions (reading) must find their "neuronal niche" a set of circuits sufficiently close to the required function
    and sufficiently plastic (...)

  - the site of VWFA is ideally suited to represent the spelling patterns of printed words because it is
    apparently designed to register complex combinations of spatially fine-grained shapes
  - ventral occipitotemporal cortex subserves visual recognition of objects based largely on shapes
  - small fine-grained stimuli that demand foveal processing tend to be processed in the more lateral areas
  - LH is dominant for analytic, feature-based shaped processing and for language


VWFA before reading

dehaene et al., 2010 fMRI
- literate, ex-illiterate, and illiterate subjects
- reading sentences and letter strings


VWFA in congenitally blind

reich et al., 2011, 2012
- fMRI study with congenitally blind subjects
- reading real and pseudowords in braille
- VWFA strong preferenc for real words than pseudowords
- activation along L ventral occipitotemporal cortex, all the way to V1
- peak voxel near central VWFA coordinates for sighted readers


reading: cognitive model

- reading aloud pseudowords like blicket requires grapheme-phoneme conversion route (sublexical)
- reading aloud regular words like leg can be done by using either the grapheme-phoneme conversion route
  or a central route that includes the orthographic and phonological lexicons as well as the semantic system
- reading aloud irregular words like yacht can only be done by using the central route but there is controversy
  about whether their proper pronunciation requires prior activation of their meaning

reading: a cognitive model

- phonological dyslexia: worse on pseudowords than real words
- surface dyslexia: worse on irregular words than on regular words and pseudowords
- deep dyslexia: impaired on pseudowords as well as real words, with errors on the latter
  often being semantic in nature and worse for abstract items
