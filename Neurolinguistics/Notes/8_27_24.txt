neurons - cells in the brain
  - ~100billion in the human brain
  - if neuron fibers were connected end to end, would stretch for 150,000 km (4x circumference of the earth)
  - cortex alone contains ~30bill w/ 1millbill connections

neuron anatomy
  - cell body (soma)
  - neucleus
  - dendrites (short branches from soma, recieve impulses from other axons)
  - axon (usually one long branch per neuron, sends impulse to other dendrites)
  - myelin sheaths (fatty tissue, insulates axon)
  - nodes of Ranvier between myelin sheaths (allows ion exchange to strengthen impulses)

impulse conduction
  - pre-synaptic axons (active conduction)
  - post-synaptic dendrites/soma (passive conduction)
  - post-synaptic axon (active conduction)

synapse
  - interface between axon and dendrite

impulse conduction action
  - depolarization
  - if threshold met, voltage gated Na+ channels open and Na+ pumped into the neuron making a positive potential
  - Na+ channels close, voltage gated K+ channels open to pump K+ out of neuron
  - K+ channels continue operating leading to overshoot of polarization

impulse conduction
  - at terminal buttons (end of axon), electrical impulses are converted to chemical neurotransmitters, cross synaptic cleft (gap)
  - are picked up by dendrite and converted back to electrical impulses

synapse
  - junction of an axon of one neuron and dendrite of another
  - terminal buttons
  - dendrite receptors

supply
  - neuronal activity requires energy
  - human brain is only 2-3% of body weight, but consumes about 20% of oxygenated blood
  - arteries are 4-10mm in diameter
  - arterioles are 20-50um
  - capillaries 10um
  - veins deoxygenated blood back to heart
  - middle cerebral artery most important for language centers of brain
  - also exist anterior and posterior cerebral arteries
