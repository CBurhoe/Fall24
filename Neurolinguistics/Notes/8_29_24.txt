Synapses
- dendrites carry signals to the cell
- axons carry signals away from the cell
- Synapses are the interface between denrites and axons

Hierarchical representation
- neurons representing elementary features project to multiple layers of higher-order "conjunctive neurons" representing increasingly complex stimuli


Parts of the brain:
- brainstem
- cerebellum
- cerebrum
  - frontal lobe
  - parietal lobe
  - occipital lobe
  - temporal lobe
  - insula

Orientation:
- planes
  - sagittal
    - bisect left and right portions
  - coronal
    - bisect anterior (Rostral) and posterior (Caudal) portions
  - horizontal
    - bisect inferior (ventral) and superior (dorsal) portions
    - aka axial or transverse
- coordinates
  - X-axis: left(-) to right(+)
  - Y-axis: posterior(-) to anterior(+)
  - Z-axis: inferior(-) to superior(+)

Brainstem:
- medulla
- pons
- midbrain
  - control homeostasis
  - houses cranial nerves to head and neck
- colliculi
- pulvinar
- thalamus
  - top of brainstem
  - sensory relay on the way to cortex
  - has reciprocal connections with all regions of the cortex

Hippocampus:
- located in medial temporal lobe
- essential for consolidating long-term declarative memories

Amygdala:
- almond-shaped structure in medial temporal lobe
- processing of emotionally and socially relevant info
- essential for fear conditioning

Basal ganglia:
- interconnected nuclei beneath frontal and temporal lobes
- receive input from cortex, send output to frontal lobes via thalamus
- important for acquisition of habits

Cerebellum:
- behind medulla and pons
- regulating muscle tone, timing, coordination of movement
- contributes to cognition

Cerebrum:
- 2 hemispheres connected by corpus callosum
- interior commisure is the (0,0,0) point for coordinate systems

Corpus callosum:
- thick band of fibers
- connects hemispheres

Ventricles:
- 4 ventricles: 2 lateral, 3rd, and 4th
- contain cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF)

Cerebral Cortex:
- gyri: ridges
- sulci: valleys
- fissure: very deep valley
- same major gyri and sulci
  - differences in precise size and locations across individuals

- Made of 6 layers (I-VI)
  - cytoarchitectonic organization
  - similarities and differences between cortical areas with respect to the presence/absence, packing densitym abd layering of various cell types
Brodmann's areas
- based on cytoarchitectonic differences among areas of cortex
