two main kinds of prosody
  - emotional
  - linguistic

two main proposals for cerebral lateralizaiton:
  #1: key factor involves acoustic features
    right lateralized
      - long duration
      - pitch variation
    left lateralized
      - short duration
      - temporal variation
  #2: key factor involves functional features
    right lateralized
      - emotional prosody
    left lateralized
      - linguistic prosody
each proposal received support, but neither can account for all data


emotional prosody:
perception
  R mid to anterior superior temporal cortex (STC)
    - auditory integration
  amygdala
    - personal relevance
  R ventral fronto-parietal cortex
    - emotional simulation
  basal ganglia (also production)
    - emotional simulation
    - sequence decoding
    - response triggering
  bilateral orbito-frontal and inferior frontal cortices
    - cognitive evaluation


linguistic prosody:
perception
  syntactic
    - "sam is going to the party too." vs "sam is going to the party too?"
    - "The boy said, 'the girl is cute'" vs "The boy, said the girl, is cute"
  lexical
    - object vs object
    - green house vs greenhouse
  tonal
    - ma (flat tone) = "mother"
    - ma (rising tone) = "numbness", "hemp"
    - ma (falling-rising) = "horse"
    - ma (falling tone) = "scold"


linguistic prosody, syntactic perception: meyer et al., 2003
  - anterior STR engaged bilaterally during perception of normal, pseudo, and degraded speech
    - prosodic processing
  - pseudo and degraded speech activated several frontal areas bilaterally
    - effortful top-down processing
  - lesions studies support that perception of prosodic cues for declarative/interrogative mood is subserved bilaterally
    - but may be mild RH bias


linguistic prosody, syntactic perception: ischebeck et al., 2008
  - listening to natural and hummed sentences with one or two prosodic (syntactic phrase) boundaries
  - two boundaries MINUS one boundary: 
    - bilateral ST activation for natural sentences
    - but just left mid ST activation for hummed sentences


linguistic prosody, lexical perception: wildgruber et al., 2004
  - 5 versions of sentence with varying emphatic stress
  - 5 versions of the same sentence with varying degrees of excitement
  - focus position - expresiveness
  - broca's area


linguistic prosody, lexical perception: walker et al., 2002
  - 24 participants
    - 8 RBD pts
    - 8 LBD pts
    - 8 healthy controls
  - determine meanigns and grammatical categories of two-syllable words that could only be disambiguated by stress cues


linguistic prosody, tone perception: wong at al., 2004
  - chinese speakers and english speakers
  - chinese - L anterior insula
  - english - R anterior insula


linguistic prosody, tone perception: xu et al., 2006
  - discrimination task
    - chinese words (C^C): chinese tones super-imposed on chinese syllables
    - tonal chimeras (C^T): thai tones superimposed on chinese syllables
  - contrasts to identify regions most responsive to native tones
    - chinese group: C^C > C^T
    - thai group: C^T > C^C
  - overlapping activation for both contrasts was found in the left planum temporale
  - PT displayed a double dissociation
    - chinese group: stronger response to chinese than thai tones
    - thai group: stronger response to thai than chinese tones

linguistic prosody: tone perception
  - neuropsychological studies support left-himesphere dominance for linguistic tone perception
  - the size of left primary auditory cortex may even be relevant (wong et al., 2008)



linguistic prosody, perception:
  - prosodic perception in the syntactic domain appears to be bilateral
    - mild RH bias for declarative/interrogative distinctions
    - mild LH bias for intonational phrase boundaries
  - prosodic perception in lexical domain appears to be primarily governed by LH
  - prosodic perception in the tonal domain appears to be primairly governed by the LH


  - acoustic considerations can explain most of these patterns of hemispheric asymmetry
  - functional considerations must be invoked to explain why linguistic tone perception is strongly left lateralized 
    whereas non-linguistic tone perception is strongly right lateralized


lignuistic prosody, production:
  - prosodic production in the syntactic domain appears to be bilateral
  - prosodic production in the lexical domain appears governed primarily by the LH
  - prosodic production in the tonal domain appears to be governed primarily by the LH
