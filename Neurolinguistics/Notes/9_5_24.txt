neuropsychology: behavioral vs lesion data

lesion overlap and subtraction analysis:
e.g. Tranel & Kemmerer, 2004
  - all 4 tasks given to 78 patients (all have lesions and deficits)
  - impaired group (N=6) failed all 4 tasks
  - unimpaired group (N=9) failed only 1 task
  - contrasted lesion overlap map for the impaired group against the lesion overlap map for the unimpaired group
  key landmarks:
    sylvian fissure
    supramarginal gyrus
    inferior frontal gyrus
    anterior temporal lobe?

voxel based lesion symptom mapping (VLSM):
  - administer a task of interst to a sample of patients with widely distributed lesions
  - for each voxel form two groups of patients, one with damage and another wihtout damage at that location
  - use t-tests to compare the behavioral data of the two groups at each voxel
  - resulting t-values provide continuously varying measures...

e.g. Wu et al., 2007: The meaning of locative prepositions
  - 14 patients with left hemisphere lesions perform a sentence-picture matching task
  - using a modified VLSM, identifies the voxels where patients with damage performed significantly worse that patients without damage


neuropsychology: caveats
  - types of deficit-lesion correlations manifested in the chronic period can be different from those manifested in the acute period
    - because acute patienst with relatively small lesions often recover rapidly due to intact areas "taking over" affected functions
  - some impariments may be attributable not to areas of damage visible on conventional MRI, but to other areas that are dysfunctional due to
    - hypoperfusion: still receive blood supply necessary to survive, but not enough to funciton normally
    - diaschisis: they depends on axonal input from the site of structural damage but that input is no longer available
  - to infer a causal relationship between impairment and lesion site, need to demonstrate not only that patients with the deficit have lesions at that site,
    but also that patients with damage at that site tend to have the deficit (biconditional/bidirectional)

e.g. Dronkers, 1996: speech apraxia (AoS)
  - 25 chronic patients with AoS (A) versus 19 chronic patients without AoS (B)
  - contrast of lesion overlap maps implicated the superior anterior part of the left insula (lobe underneath frontal lobe)

e.g. Hillis et al., 2004b: speech apraxia (AoS)
  - 40 acute patients with left insular damage and 40 acute patients without
  - scanned for areas of structural damage and/or hypoperfusion
  - AoS was not significantly related to abnormalities in the superior anterior part of the left insula
    - actually is the case that insula is very commonly damaged during strokes
  - looked at Broca's area, much stronger correlation found



functional neuroimaging:
  - look at function vs just anatomy (structural neuroimaging)
  - hemodynamic methods: measure regional changes in blood flow associated wiht neural activity
    - positron emission tomography (PET)
    - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
  fMRI
    - when brain is engaged in a cognitive process the active neurons rapidly consume oxygen that is already available (0.5-1.5% change for active regions)
    - during next few seconds, overabundance of oxygen in blood?

  PET
    - 15O labeled water is injected into blood stream (half-life ~2 min, eliminated in 10 min)
    - travels in blood to the areas with higher metabolism
    - 15O molecule is unstable, loses positron
    - positron attracted to electron, collide 2-3mm away, both annihilated creating 2 photons moving in opposite directions
    - radiation detectors detect the photons
    - algorithmically compute location of annihilation
    - where number of events is large there is greater blood flow indicating more neural activity
    - spatial resolution ~10mm
    - temporal resolution ~30 seconds at best
  
  fMRI
    - measure the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal which decreases when blood is deoxygenated and increases when blood is oxygenated
    - hemodynamic response function (HRF) shows how the BOLD signal evolves over time
      - initial dip as immediately available oxygen is consumed (1-2s)
      - steady rise as freshly oxygenated blood is delivered (5s)
      - gradual drop as the signal returns to baseline (5s)
    - spatial resolution ~3mm or less depending on magnet
    - temporal resolution ~6-9s, even shorter than the HRF (50-100 ms)

functional neuroimaging: co-registration
  - imaging data are typically combined across subjects, which requires warping each subjects brain so that it fits a standard template brain (stereotaxic space)
  - significant activations are reported with reference to the voxels of the standard template brain
  - some studies plot functional data directly on each subjects anatomical data
  - Talairach & Tourneaux, 1988 template
  - Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
  - coordinate system of the human brain
  - anterior commissure (0,0,0)
  - 1mm increments

functional neuroimaging: experimental design
  - block design
    - stimuli from same condition presented consecutively together
    - required for PET, optional for fMRI
  - event-related design
    - stimuli from one condition are randomly interspersed with stimuli from another condition
    - impossible for PET, possible/preferred for fMRI
