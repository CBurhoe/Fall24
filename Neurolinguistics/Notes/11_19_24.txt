Sentence comprehension ERP components

N400 & P600

N400
  waveform properties
  - semantic anomaly
  - spoken and written sentences
  - negative polarity plotted at top
  - 250ms onset; 400ms peak
  - strongest over central and parietal electrodes
  - amplitude reflects the degree of difficulty of integrating the meaning of the word in context

encountering a semantic anomaly results in a negative peak 400 ms after stimulus


N400
  - amplitude sensitive to number of semantic features that an unexpected word shares with the expected word
  - sensitive to violations of not only language-specific semantic structure but also general world knowledge

P600
  waveform properties
  - sensitive to syntactic violations
  - printed and spoken sentences
  - positive polarity
  - 500-600ms onset, 500ms duration
  - strongest over central and parietal electrodes

P600
  - evoked by many different kinds of syntactic violations
  - can also be elicited by at least three types of grammatically well-formed sentences
    - garden path sentences
    - complex sentences
    - sentences in which the meanings of the NPs and the verb lead the the reader/hearer to expect an arrangement
      of participant roles that would be plausible in the read world, but the syntactic cues (...)

ELAN
  waveform properties
  - syntactic violation
  - biphasic: ELAN + P600
  - ELAN
  - negative polarity
  - 100-300ms post onset
  - seems to index initial, automatic detection of an error

ELAN and sustained negativity


that's all folks. thank you for taking neurolinguistics!

mapping brain activation patterns in syntactic vs lexical tone processing

question: how do syntactic tones in Teso engage distinct or overlapping regions compared to lexical tones in Mandarin
