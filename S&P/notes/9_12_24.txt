syn flooding attack

idea: fill the queue storing half-open connections so that there will be no space to store TCB for any new half-open connection
basically server cannot accept any new SYN packets

steps to achieve
- continuously send a lot of SYN packets to the server to consume space in the queue
- need to spoof IP


before the attack
- check TCP states

TCP states
- listen: waiting for 


countermeasures
- SYN cookies


TCP reset attack
- to disconnect a connection: A sends out FIN packet, B replies with ACK
- now, B sends a FIN packet to A, and A replies with ACK


TCP session hijacking attack
- inject arbitrary data into established connection with a spoofed packet
